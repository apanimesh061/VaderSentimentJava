1_2	0.0	0.565	0.435	0.6597	repost from january 13, 2004 with a better fit title.
1_3	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.34	does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video?
1_4	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.1779	or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white?
1_5	0.087	0.776	0.137	0.1531	before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support, or run the player over with your car, try these simple troubleshooting ideas first.
1_6	0.185	0.588	0.227	0.128	no picture:  hopefully you still have the remote control.
1_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you tossed it out the window, you need to fetch it.
1_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	using the remote control, press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote.
1_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive.
1_10	0.109	0.891	0.0	-0.1511	if this doesnt bring back the picture, try pressing this button without playing a dvd.
1_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you dont get video back, now you can run the player over with your car!
1_12	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.4902	picture scrolling in b/w:  you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard.
1_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote.
1_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc.
1_15	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	by pressing p/n, you should be able to get a good picture on the screen.
1_16	0.098	0.618	0.284	0.6249	for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp  i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips.
1_17	0.108	0.892	0.0	-0.3182	i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal.
1_18	0.0	0.668	0.332	0.6105	im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button!
1_19	0.146	0.854	0.0	-0.34	the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place.
1_20	0.0	0.681	0.319	0.7959	but, if you're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player, i love it!
1_21	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.25	it practically plays almost everything you give it.
1_22	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.4404	i've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor.
1_23	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.3382	for the price it is a well spent investment!
1_24	0.0	0.545	0.455	0.3612	i would recommend buying one.
2_1	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	incredibe price / performance.
2_2	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.4939	i've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998.  this is by far the nicest one, in so many ways.
2_3	0.0	0.673	0.327	0.807	it's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout, and it has a great feature set.
2_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i've had.
2_5	0.0	0.646	0.354	0.5256	it plays alternate video formats (vcds, svcds, cvds) very well.
2_6	0.161	0.625	0.214	0.25	and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong?
2_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom.
2_8	0.0	0.51	0.49	0.5859	strengths are well listed by other reviewers.
2_9	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.34	what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files (e., mp3s).
2_10	0.0	0.436	0.564	0.3802	it sure does!
2_11	0.0	0.563	0.437	0.4767	that's a rare and valuable feature.
2_12	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.4926	i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s, and it's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time (dvd-r) than 0.7 gb at a time (cd-r)!
2_13	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.4215	another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs, though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i'd scanned before buying.
2_14	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.4215	saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable, as i already had a coax cable.
2_15	0.0	0.918	0.082	0.2003	at double-speed (2x forward speed), it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth, but twice as fast!
2_16	0.0	0.78	0.22	0.5859	i wish it would do the same for movies, but that's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo.
2_17	0.063	0.937	0.0	-0.3612	weaknesses are minor: the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so; it doesn't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names; you must cycle through every zoom setting (2x, 3x, 4x, 1/2x, etc.
2_18	0.159	0.841	0.0	-0.34	) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ].
2_19	0.0	0.565	0.435	0.8399	if you're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price, i highly recommend this model.
2_20	0.0	0.798	0.202	0.4199	update: the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it!
3_1	0.337	0.663	0.0	-0.2584	doesnt play new disney movies.
3_2	0.169	0.831	0.0	-0.2584	many of our disney movies don't play on this dvd player.
3_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months.
4_1	0.592	0.408	0.0	-0.7003	poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd's.
4_2	0.114	0.763	0.123	0.0516	player has a problem with dual-layer dvd's such as alias season 1 and season 2.  for the money, get a better quality player.
4_3	0.0	0.629	0.371	0.7579	player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd's to play.
4_4	0.12	0.721	0.159	0.3182	i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse.
4_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	will never purchase apex again.
4_6	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.5859	customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them.
4_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	pass this player up, and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas!
5_1	0.314	0.686	0.0	-0.4939	has destroyed several of my dvds and cds.
5_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for the first few weeks, this player was everything i expected it to be, an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised.
5_3	0.122	0.778	0.1	-0.1027	then my dvds would stop playing in the middle, or not even be read at all.
5_4	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.25	new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays.
5_5	0.102	0.898	0.0	-0.3612	i thought it was just the player, but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media.
5_6	0.0	0.711	0.289	0.69	there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk!
5_7	0.103	0.742	0.155	0.2105	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you don't purchase it.

10_4	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.4939	save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month.

11_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation.
11_5	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.5106	it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time.
11_6	0.122	0.746	0.131	0.0772	the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing, which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air.
11_7	0.172	0.828	0.0	-0.4019	"  this problem vanished after the first month, so i assume it was a temporary dust issue.
11_10	0.065	0.835	0.1	0.1779	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist, and i discovered by accident (it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting.
11_11	0.164	0.739	0.097	-0.2484	the remote is okay, but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons.
11_12	0.094	0.684	0.222	0.4576	i especially like the more commonly used buttons, such as play, pause, and stop, to be larger and conveniently placed.
11_13	0.0	0.749	0.251	0.6908	while it is true that it will stand on end, it is also easy to knock over that way.
11_14	0.105	0.895	0.0	-0.2755	i also didn't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode.
11_15	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.5574	the zoom goes up and down in magnification, which is nice, but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings.

11_19	0.085	0.692	0.223	0.5267	while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs, mine has run well, and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase.
11_20	0.174	0.648	0.177	0.0243	any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor, along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support.
11_21	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.5574	while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4, i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it.

13_3	0.068	0.897	0.035	-0.296	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who doesn't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as (i believe) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked.
13_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	as i emailed to the the customer service department, the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning.

44_1	0.403	0.597	0.0	-0.4019	has problems reading some dvds.
44_2	0.063	0.689	0.249	0.7351	good:  progressive scan player for a relatively low price (although the better known manufacturers like toshiba, pioneer, and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well).
44_3	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.2682	seems to read most dvds fine, and reads quietly (i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise).

44_6	0.058	0.745	0.198	0.7543	bad:  i've had this player for several months and it reads most discs, but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players (from friends season 2).
44_7	0.306	0.694	0.0	-0.5267	it would just spin up and stop, and display " no disc ".
44_8	0.333	0.667	0.0	-0.7902	my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote, which is worse than other, cheaper apex units.
44_9	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.34	for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button, a ring around the enter / play button.
44_10	0.08	0.92	0.0	-0.1027	you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll.
44_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also, for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video, with lots of color bleeding, compared to a component connection (should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv).

54_3	0.104	0.635	0.261	0.5719	the prior one looked and felt lightweight, cheesy, and assembled by the oppressed:  i purchased it for it's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks.
54_4	0.17	0.758	0.072	-0.5719	i used it lightly, and it lasted just over one year (forgot to kill the power one day, and now it only plays dvds).

54_8	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.4404	4.  remote: you can stand it on end (harder to lose), and it's far better designed than the 1100s.
54_9	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.7717	anyway, the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product.
54_10	0.0	0.79	0.21	0.8519	i'd have given it 5 stars, but i'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one:  with progressive scan, i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest.
55_1	0.187	0.813	0.0	-0.5917	does not play dvds with extra features... first of all, i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed.

55_4	0.17	0.714	0.115	-0.25	what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds.
55_5	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.1027	for example, i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd, but this dvd player can not read it.

60_13	0.091	0.705	0.203	0.4019	it works well enough (so far) for me to be satisfied with it, and it's possible that i'm missing something.
60_14	0.216	0.679	0.105	-0.5023	but i would expect that, since my movie discs have all played with no problem, the extras discs would, too, without any additional tweaking.

87_3	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.2023	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine.
87_4	0.099	0.809	0.092	-0.0516	there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open (my prev.
87_5	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.2023	machine did it automatically), and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance.
87_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	still, i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features!
87_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch.
87_8	0.188	0.812	0.0	-0.1007	i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes!
87_9	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	ok, that happens, so i try to skip the chapter.
87_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nothing!
87_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it wouldn't do it!
87_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i try navigating using the player's built in menu, and it still wouldn't work!
87_13	0.244	0.756	0.0	-0.4404	my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged.
87_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause.
87_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see.
87_16	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.34	the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question.
87_17	0.283	0.578	0.139	-0.3612	i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either.
87_18	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	guess where this unit is headed?
87_19	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup, right back for a refund!
88_1	0.125	0.666	0.209	0.2554	more trouble than it's worth times 10. i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player.
88_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i am even a bit technology oriented, so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up.
88_3	0.179	0.821	0.0	-0.34	unfortunately, the player would not read any of my region one dvds.
88_4	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.3412	even though they were not damaged in any way.
88_5	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.25	i called apex's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing.
88_6	0.0	0.619	0.381	0.7902	i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different, more trusted brand of dvd player.
89_1	0.0	0.455	0.545	0.34	value for money.
89_2	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.34	this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it.
89_3	0.027	0.838	0.135	0.7906	the plus points are -  1.  price  2.  ability to play most discs - i tried dvd, vcd, dvd-r, audio cd and it played all  3.  good looks  the downside -  1.  the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate, something that you wouldn't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel  2.  remote buttons are small and closely spaced, especially with the menu buttons.
89_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed, i would rate this a 5 star machine.

94_6	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.3083	i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats, but others say they can.

99_9	0.0	0.908	0.092	0.3071	ensure you get a larger flash, 128 or 256, some are selling with the larger flash, 32mb will do in a pinch but you'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras.
99_10	0.0	0.614	0.386	0.8899	bottom line, well made camera, easy to use, very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices.

100_4	0.0	0.841	0.159	0.6486	just a little overview, powershot g3 is the flagship of canon's powershot series and its an slr-like camera, its 4 megapixel and (alsmost) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance.

101_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	incredible camera i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras.
101_3	0.038	0.75	0.212	0.7902	a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful, as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made, plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models.
101_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	following my research, i decided on the g3.
101_5	0.0	0.661	0.339	0.6249	in a word, " awesome " is how i would describe this camera.
101_6	0.0	0.797	0.203	0.8732	i won't go into the details here, as the online sites (stevesdigicams, dpreviews) go into great depth in their reviews, but i am very pleased with the features, the speed, the picture quality, the flexibility, the automation, and the functional conveniences this camera offers.
101_7	0.0	0.743	0.257	0.4791	with the automatic settings, i really haven't taken a bad picture yet.
101_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and with the panoramic " stitch " mode, it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image.
101_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i am absolutely in awe of this camera, canon put enormous quality into the g3.
101_10	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.5505	don't walk, run and buy this camera if you have the budget, i guarantee you will not be disappointed.
102_1	0.0	0.661	0.339	0.8016	great camera i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied.
102_2	0.0	0.814	0.186	0.4939	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality.
102_3	0.0	0.799	0.201	0.7003	the g3 is loaded with many useful features, and unlike many smaller digital cameras, it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds.
102_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	flaws?
102_5	0.096	0.904	0.0	-0.5416	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle, but since i use the lcd most of the time, this is not really much of a bother to me.
102_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera.
102_7	0.066	0.657	0.278	0.6364	despite this minor disappointment, i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography.
103_1	0.0	0.697	0.303	0.9161	haven't had practice but i'm already in love with it i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful.
103_2	0.0	0.664	0.336	0.7964	the photo quality is amazing and i know i'm going to have fun with all the features.
103_3	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.4144	i've figured out most of its features on my own already (because i have used digital cameras before, so i know things like symbols).
103_4	0.042	0.751	0.207	0.8037	i'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top, but that doesn't stop me from loving this camera.
103_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial.
103_6	0.044	0.956	0.0	-0.1689	its very small and hard to turn so you can't get an accurate adjustment (for those of you who don't know what a diopter adjustment is, it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight.)
103_7	0.0	0.834	0.166	0.5542	i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review.
104_1	0.024	0.614	0.361	0.9518	excellent for the semi-serious amateur positives  1) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative, yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you don't want to bother with the settings.
104_2	0.0	0.463	0.537	0.7003	excellent range of metering options as well.
104_3	0.0	0.785	0.215	0.6249	it's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen.
104_4	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.7845	2) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera (semi-serious amateur photographer)  3) 4x zoom is nice  4) the great thing about digital, in general, is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture, not two weeks later when you get the film developed.
104_5	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.2944	5) its focusing system is also very flexible.
104_6	0.036	0.89	0.074	0.3804	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button, and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus.
104_7	0.032	0.968	0.0	-0.1682	negatives  1) quite bulky (it's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr) and uses a heavy battery, although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic (unlike canon's elph line)  2) not very ergonomical - you'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens)  4) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying.
105_1	0.0	0.523	0.477	0.8074	fantastic digital camera the camera has a wonderful set of features.
105_2	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.4404	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures.
105_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd.
105_4	0.038	0.717	0.245	0.7956	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry.
105_5	0.0	0.619	0.381	0.5719	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect.
105_6	0.117	0.734	0.149	0.1918	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures (purple fringing, etc) so i am very pleased.

113_2	0.11	0.782	0.108	0.221	before i " get used to it ", here are my first feelings:  a) the picture quality (color and sharpness of focusing) are so great, it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time: -))  b) the lens cover is surely loose, i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times, and au lens tigt and cause potential damage.

115_23	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3182	sure.
115_24	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.5157	it is less versatile, but i am never disappointed with the output.
116_1	0.056	0.834	0.111	0.3384	within its limitations i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment, just so you know my bias.
116_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i have been watching the development of digicams for years, waiting to make my first move.
116_3	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.1513	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses.
116_4	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.296	i figure that is at least three years off, and i am getting impatient.
116_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations.
116_6	0.0	0.802	0.198	0.4522	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality, clean images.
116_7	0.077	0.839	0.084	0.0571	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks (even in bright light), and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash.
116_8	0.194	0.728	0.078	-0.4791	as of this writing, technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr.
116_9	0.066	0.854	0.08	0.128	at least once youve got focus lock, the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second, which from what ive read, is better than just about anything else available.
116_10	0.173	0.827	0.0	-0.5859	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8.
116_11	0.172	0.764	0.064	-0.5267	once i get focus lock, i can then wait until my restless subject (a pet or a child) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus.
116_12	0.351	0.649	0.0	-0.4019	now what about the flash problem?
116_13	0.19	0.736	0.074	-0.5859	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr, the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh, flat images with ugly hot spots.
116_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	fortunately, the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash, and fortunately for me, i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy: the metz 60 ct-4.
116_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera, but i can use my metz, with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4.
116_16	0.0	0.94	0.06	0.3612	for those who have this metz flash (or the 45cl-3) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3, the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c.
116_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in order for this to work, you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself.
116_18	0.0	0.897	0.103	0.4588	contrary to what ive read elsewhere, the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes, just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon.
116_19	0.0	0.944	0.056	0.0772	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync, which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow.
116_20	0.149	0.851	0.0	-0.4939	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel, because they are all ignored.
116_21	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash, and most of the time, the exposure is spot on and when it isnt, its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself.
116_22	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing, or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away.
116_23	0.416	0.584	0.0	-0.856	unfortunately, the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available, so the first problem cant easily be solved.
116_24	0.136	0.758	0.106	-0.1531	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz (with the attendant shadows unfortunately).
116_25	0.0	0.799	0.201	0.7776	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range, the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera.
116_26	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted, enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you.
116_27	0.055	0.72	0.225	0.6124	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine.
116_28	0.089	0.911	0.0	-0.6352	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images (i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf, which gives me 130 raw images, as opposed to 7!
116_29	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all, but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera.
116_30	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information.
116_31	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.4215	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software, youd see the true, raw image that the camera actually produces.
116_32	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i didnt wait to experiment.
116_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	instead, i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in.
116_34	0.0	0.686	0.314	0.6705	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware.
116_35	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	without any tweaking at all, if the exposure is accurate, the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film, and this is a raw image!
116_36	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software.
116_37	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.3182	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical.
116_38	0.0	0.848	0.152	0.34	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality, and then if you want fantasy, you can use photoshop to create it.
116_39	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera.
116_40	0.08	0.802	0.118	0.4203	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 (in conjunction with my professional flash system), and can easily put up with the cameras limitations, because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits.
117_1	0.0	0.682	0.318	0.7906	knock your socks off great i've had this for 3 months now, and i am pleased with my decision.
117_2	0.088	0.511	0.401	0.8225	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well.
117_3	0.082	0.785	0.133	0.3612	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time.

117_7	0.0	0.7	0.3	0.8402	i did a good month's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras, and this is the best buy for the buck.
117_8	0.058	0.728	0.214	0.7469	not perfect (yes, the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances), not the cheapest 4.0 mp, but the best 4.0 mp.
117_9	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.2732	if you don't believe me on that, check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there.

118_8	0.069	0.751	0.179	0.5859	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot, i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced.
118_9	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.5574	the camera is a dream to operate in automode, but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority, shutter priority, and manual modes.
118_10	0.07	0.821	0.109	0.3182	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom.

119_1	0.172	0.566	0.263	0.6712	canon never ceases to amaze being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation, difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2.
119_2	0.35	0.371	0.278	-0.1967	but canon never fails to amaze.
119_3	0.0	0.657	0.343	0.888	some of the great gains over g2 --  1. the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility.
119_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	2. battery life is over 4.5 hours, compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons.
119_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	3. the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing.
119_6	0.0	0.88	0.12	0.3723	looks sort of like picasa software (google it if you dont know) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2's, but more intuitive.
119_7	0.056	0.753	0.191	0.5288	4. the shape of this device is a little squarer, without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking.
119_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a big plus in my book.
119_9	0.092	0.748	0.161	0.296	5. the 1/200 sec, f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed (or very brightly lit) environments.

119_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	6. the g2's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed, the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes.
119_13	0.072	0.856	0.072	0.0	there are six default settings (off, vivid, sepia, neutral, low sharpening, b &amp; w) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening, contrast and saturation.

119_15	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.5267	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera.
119_16	0.0	0.785	0.215	0.5095	(looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have, er, canonized it a bit).
119_17	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.4939	8. perhaps inspired by the canon's factory white-correction settings (which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out), the g3 has much sharper white offsets.
119_18	0.0	0.788	0.212	0.6249	in english, this means that even straight out of the box, you'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking.
119_19	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.6369	9. in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera, and thankfully g3 maintains this rep.  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors.
119_20	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.6369	overall, the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams, from a detail, tonal balance and color response point of view.
119_21	0.245	0.755	0.0	-0.3818	there's really very little about g3 images to criticize.
119_22	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon (both slrs).
119_23	0.0	0.668	0.332	0.6666	this is quite simply the best you can ask for.

125_9	0.206	0.794	0.0	-0.3804	1) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera.
125_11	0.193	0.663	0.145	-0.2023	i'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap, i may damage the lens.
125_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	very cheaply made.
125_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	2) the body construction - buttons, casing, etc, are too plastic.

125_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing.

126_9	0.0	0.895	0.105	0.25	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features, so i generally used the auto mode.

127_9	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.4471	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging.
127_10	0.113	0.722	0.165	0.25	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures.
127_11	0.0	0.76	0.24	0.6249	the optical zoom is awesome, and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom.
127_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder, but does not detract from the image at all.
127_13	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.6369	as i said, this is the last digital camera i'll buy, and if you are in the market one, my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever.

129_5	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.7717	i compared it to the olympus c5050z, the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700.  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews, this one seemed like the best all round deal.
129_6	0.428	0.572	0.0	-0.4585	it is not perfect though.
129_7	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.4215	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far:  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera.
129_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder.
129_9	0.113	0.722	0.165	0.25	(i knew this before hand, and it is not that bad) there is no tiff format.
129_10	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.4215	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw.
129_11	0.114	0.653	0.233	0.4404	to save a picture as raw, you have to have the display on, this seems like a waste of battery power.
129_12	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.4005	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter?

129_17	0.0	0.808	0.192	0.7346	i have not spent much time with the included software, so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok.  i am quite happy with the camera.

132_5	0.129	0.766	0.105	-0.1531	also, the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions, or to protect it against any damage.
132_6	0.0	0.2	0.8	0.6114	excellent idea!
132_7	0.271	0.729	0.0	-0.7717	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card, and for most purposes, it is not enough.
132_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	however, it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras.
132_9	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i've seen.

134_13	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.3612	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped, picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience.

136_8	0.123	0.852	0.025	-0.805	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion (i don't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i'm going to get) in the viewfinder when you don't zoom (when you zoom the lens distortion goes away), canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture.
136_9	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.4497	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon.
136_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the distortion is not a flaw.
136_11	0.112	0.837	0.05	-0.3818	as with taking digital pictures, i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand.

136_17	0.026	0.974	0.0	-0.1027	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash (enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash.
136_18	0.282	0.682	0.036	-0.8519	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions (camera and cf) bending (can lead to cf erros) or losing it.

139_6	0.0	0.834	0.166	0.4201	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder, i highly recommend the camera.
139_7	0.106	0.894	0.0	-0.3818	however for me, i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much.
139_8	0.184	0.816	0.0	-0.4019	i'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected.
140_1	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.6369	i love it more the longer i own it i've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year, and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom, more adjustability, a hot shoe for an external flash, and a remote control.
140_2	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.5563	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3, and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics (much more comfortable to hold and use) and the price.
140_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far.
140_4	0.0	0.653	0.347	0.4927	and so far, i've been very pleased.
140_5	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.144	there's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330, especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures.
140_6	0.078	0.815	0.107	0.2023	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light, and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer.
140_7	0.0	0.549	0.451	0.6249	the moveable lcd screen is great.
140_8	0.129	0.761	0.11	0.0772	you can take pictures with the camera held above your head, way down, or beside you with no problem, allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself.
140_9	0.0	0.866	0.134	0.5719	the tiny (postage-stamp sized) remote unit is wonderful: not only does it trigger the shutter, it can also be used to zoom and review pictures.
140_10	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.7579	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod: the combination of the new camera, tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor, natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before.
140_11	0.036	0.75	0.214	0.9274	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit:  i chose the canon speedlite 420.  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs: the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos, red-eye, and annoying shadows; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing, almost-natural lighting.
140_12	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.5499	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330, but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse:  i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery.
140_13	0.032	0.968	0.0	-0.1027	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras: the battery needs to be charged while in the camera, but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery.
140_14	0.0	0.832	0.168	0.7227	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options: shutter priority, aperature priority, light metering adjustments, etc., but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear.
140_15	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.5106	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting, or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do.

140_17	0.11	0.765	0.125	0.079	i've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330, and the g3 seems to do only slightly better.
140_18	0.116	0.884	0.0	-0.3612	(i'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level.)
140_19	0.182	0.818	0.0	-0.5994	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy, and has an awkward, tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera.
140_20	0.148	0.852	0.0	-0.5106	and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic, a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330.
140_21	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i bought a 512 mb card, which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution.
140_22	0.216	0.784	0.0	-0.5267	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly, but there's no difference in working with the files.
140_23	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.4939	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images:  i can imagine that they'd fill up my ibook's internal memory pretty quickly.
140_24	0.133	0.867	0.0	-0.4449	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe's photoshop elments 2.0 software, and can't praise it highly enough.
140_25	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you're investing in a camera at this level, buy this software!
140_26	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.4215	and as i said in my review of the s330, all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers.
140_27	0.046	0.954	0.0	-0.0772	the bottom line: if you're serious about your digital photography, or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot, this may be just the camera for you.
140_28	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.4497	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time: you'll see the difference in your photos immediately.
140_29	0.0	0.834	0.166	0.4927	added 2-24.  i've now had the camera for two months and i'm even more pleased with it.
140_30	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting.
140_31	0.251	0.615	0.133	-0.3182	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures, especially in mixed-light settings.
140_32	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you don't have a gray card, you can use a plain white piece of paper.
140_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting, which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter: the first at the camera-determined exposure, then one lighter and one darker.
140_34	0.0	0.653	0.347	0.4927	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations.
140_35	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i did buy the telephoto lens (and the required extension).

141_3	0.0	0.898	0.102	0.3612	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life, enthusiast features, external flash capabilities, available storage types, image formats, and more.
141_4	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.1761	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features.
141_5	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.4235	it can be a point-and-shoot camera, but if you do not intend to " get into " it's finer features, i'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice.
141_6	0.116	0.64	0.244	0.4939	all-in-all, i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market.
142_1	0.0	0.777	0.223	0.9217	the best so far the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it, and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance (picture quality and battery life) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera.

142_4	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.3182	the canon allows you to change lenses, and it accepts the ibm microdrive (type ii compact flash), so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage.

142_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking, it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap, and it is a bit slow between shots.

145_4	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.2023	you can use the scene modes, or fine tune the options, i. you can change the iso level, shutter speed, etc.
145_5	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.4215	this camera is ideal for people who want more power, but don't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera.
146_1	0.135	0.865	0.0	-0.2584	not too excited i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400.
146_3	0.345	0.655	0.0	-0.5773	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid.

146_5	0.495	0.505	0.0	-0.5994	i've had no problem with canon whatsoever.
146_6	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.4404	with nikon, although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras, i've had the following headaches;  1. pictures won't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable.
146_7	0.114	0.886	0.0	-0.4767	i did everything i could, and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader.

146_11	0.0	0.846	0.154	0.3724	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar.
146_12	0.115	0.656	0.229	0.2716	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries.
147_1	0.0	0.664	0.336	0.7964	only " cons " here the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera, which i do agree.
147_2	0.0	0.883	0.117	0.3919	but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though,.
147_3	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.1695	this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can't be stopped.
147_4	0.048	0.854	0.098	0.3167	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing.. if you want to have the date; time on the image, its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date; time from the images meta-data.
147_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so if you use your card reader; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date; time.
147_6	0.063	0.937	0.0	-0.4005	in that too, there isn't a direct way to add date; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date; time.. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image.
147_7	0.355	0.645	0.0	-0.412	images taken indoor weren't so clear.
147_8	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.2732	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit.
147_9	0.428	0.572	0.0	-0.4576	lens cap is a really annoying.
147_10	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	go; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card.
147_11	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.3995	else with simpler viking cf cards, it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size: 1600.. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can't avoid that.
147_12	0.0	0.527	0.473	0.9126	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity; an exceptional close-up shooting capability.
147_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix.

148_3	0.162	0.838	0.0	-0.4019	i send my camera to nikon for servicing, took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem.

148_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and labor!
148_7	0.115	0.747	0.138	-0.0617	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality, but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service.

150_2	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.6369	nikon 4300, i feel, is the best camera out there for the features and price.
150_3	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.8988	here were my requirements in a digital camera:  1. i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while.
150_4	0.257	0.743	0.0	-0.6398	2. i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i wasn't comfortable with that.
150_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily.
150_6	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.6597	3. i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although, i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings.
150_7	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.2617	4. and, of course, i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but hadn't used it much.
150_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	depending on all the above requirements, i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models.
150_9	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.4404	nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes, medium; compact size, price, brand name, good software that is included and previous reviews.
150_10	0.0	0.715	0.285	0.6115	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since.
150_11	0.0	0.729	0.271	0.624	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details.
150_12	0.075	0.836	0.09	0.1263	a few things that might make it even better:  1. pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance.
150_13	0.058	0.942	0.0	-0.228	2. it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow.
150_14	0.082	0.918	0.0	-0.1779	3. the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture.
150_15	0.33	0.67	0.0	-0.7832	all the above, i think, are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints.
150_16	0.186	0.69	0.124	-0.2263	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems.
150_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	whichever camera you buy, add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card, usb card reader, camera bag and the warranty.
150_18	0.056	0.789	0.155	0.5233	and finally, get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness.

152_8	0.052	0.948	0.0	-0.1779	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button, which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models.

161_1	0.208	0.631	0.161	-0.1877	not disappointed great camera, and for the price you can't beat it.
161_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i've been using it for about 3 months now.
161_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly.
161_4	0.0	0.423	0.577	0.6249	the quality is superb.
161_5	0.224	0.677	0.099	-0.4497	the small size is perfect for my little hands, but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person.
162_1	0.0	0.85	0.15	0.5719	field tested we use older versions 880, 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos.
162_2	0.0	0.82	0.18	0.5106	the 4300 is a very durable, compact package, and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust.
162_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade!
162_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	we got a 256mb card, and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend.
162_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the only drawbacks that i have noticed:  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long, especially if you use the flash a lot.
162_6	0.0	0.834	0.166	0.4902	so, it's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging.
162_7	0.073	0.83	0.097	0.1779	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light.
162_8	0.122	0.708	0.169	0.2936	i would say that this is not a major issue, but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things.
162_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it has a 3x optical zoom, which is average for these cameras.
162_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for more, you sacrifice weight and size: more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length.
162_11	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.1027	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom, but you sacrifice quality.
162_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason:  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries.
162_13	0.064	0.936	0.0	-0.3818	in manual, you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic; this is not really a hinderance, you just have to be familiar with its menus and features.
162_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in reality, these are the only drawbacks this camera has, much less than many other models!
162_15	0.0	0.678	0.322	0.732	it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks, so don't think i hate this camera.
162_16	0.075	0.693	0.233	0.6077	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping.
162_17	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.3384	for work, we use them in the field often, and they hold up really well.
162_18	0.0	0.463	0.537	0.7003	they take excellent macro shots as well.
162_19	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4404	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access, and it takes silent movies.
163_1	0.121	0.757	0.121	-0.0015	it don't get better i compared this to a lot of other cameras, believe me, it's value for money.

164_1	0.0	0.76	0.24	0.7184	excellent compact digital camera i am a nikon fan, and owned and used slr nikon fe, n50 and n90s for many many years.
164_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card.
164_3	0.0	0.807	0.193	0.8442	as expected, i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models, and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately.
164_4	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.4201	i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
164_5	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.4927	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them.
164_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	try to buy a high capacity ultra card, as it's 2x as faster as the regular cf card.
164_7	0.089	0.599	0.312	0.6904	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download, it's well worth the little extra money.
164_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy, so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation.
164_9	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.3818	use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run.
164_10	0.0	0.964	0.036	0.1027	one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures, one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics, but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb, the math does not add up.
164_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per.

165_2	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.5423	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken.

166_1	0.121	0.692	0.187	0.6713	absolutely great point and shoot camera first of all, let's start with my needs: 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution, 3 optical clarity and color, 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture, 5 compact size, and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake.
166_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for three months, i've researched the internet and magazines, queried various sales personnel, and took hands-on in-store test drives.
166_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300.  i have it for a week now, and this camera has exceeded my expectations.
166_4	0.075	0.685	0.24	0.6997	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away.
166_5	0.077	0.865	0.058	-0.296	the shutter lag is on par with what i've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more.
166_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple.
166_7	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.6369	the only drawbacks i've encountered are: 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color, but i've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i've used even on a nikon slr.
166_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	right now, i'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that's designed for digital cameras.

166_11	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.4404	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment.
166_12	0.188	0.718	0.095	-0.3462	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate, but not very robust.

166_14	0.116	0.884	0.0	-0.2732	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing.
166_15	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.2023	just for the heck of it, i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door, and the focusing was just fine.

175_3	0.068	0.75	0.182	0.5017	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i haven't played with it too much on manual.
175_4	0.0	0.673	0.327	0.5267	it's size also makes it ideal for travel.
175_5	0.0	0.642	0.358	0.6786	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable, robust, and useful little camera.
176_1	0.0	0.213	0.787	0.8126	excellent phone, excellent service.
176_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service.
176_3	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.7475	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone, it is a great phone, mine worked without any problems right out of the box.
176_4	0.0	0.752	0.248	0.5574	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted.
176_5	0.159	0.758	0.083	-0.4574	after several years of torture in the hands of at&amp;t customer service i am delighted to drop them, and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&amp;t to t-mobile!
176_6	0.0	0.819	0.181	0.9062	i have had the phone for 1 week, the signal quality has been great in the detroit area (suburbs) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky (cincinnati) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75, far superior to at &amp;#38; t's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route.
176_7	0.057	0.833	0.109	0.4588	i have owned motorola, panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia, this phone combines many of the best nokia features, the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition.
176_8	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.4588	my favorite features, although there are many, are the speaker phone, the radio and the infrared.
176_9	0.0	0.934	0.066	0.0516	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car, very audible even with freeway noise.
176_10	0.0	0.767	0.233	0.743	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone, saved me hours of re-entering my numbers.
176_11	0.0	0.695	0.305	0.7645	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service (signal, price, service) is a winner, i highly recommend it.
177_1	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	good phone, so-so service.
177_2	0.104	0.696	0.2	0.2732	the day finally arrived when i was sure i'd leave sprint.
177_3	0.212	0.788	0.0	-0.5423	after years with that carrier's expensive plans and horrible customer service, portability seemed heaven-sent.
177_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile, so i gave it a whirl.
177_5	0.0	0.76	0.24	0.743	here's the brief synopsis: the phone is tiny, cute, feels kind of " plastic-like " (as if it might break), but seems pretty sturdy.
177_6	0.0	0.759	0.241	0.6915	it has lots of little cute features, my favorite being the games and the pim (personal information manager -- i.e.
177_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	organizer), and the radio!
177_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i spent hours setting up the stations (accepts about 13-14, i believe), though the reception is unpredictable.
177_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also, you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious.
177_10	0.156	0.638	0.206	0.088	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine!
177_11	0.0	0.914	0.086	0.3612	the phone comes with okay ringtones, some decent backgrounds / screensavers, but the phone has very little memory (mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon, so you don't have too many options on what you can put on there).
177_12	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.4215	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i'd have liked them to be.
177_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	however, it serves its purpose.
177_14	0.078	0.922	0.0	-0.296	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly (dangerous when you're driving at night), and there's no way to change this --  i checked with nokia.
177_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the buttons on the phone are small, even for my small fingertips, but you get used to them rather quickly.
177_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the menu options are uncreative, as you can't see a full screen of menu items to pick from; you have to scroll up and down to find what you're looking for (yes, this is minor, but not when you're trying to keep your eye on the road!).
177_17	0.364	0.636	0.0	-0.3167	more downside to this phone?
177_18	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the volume.
177_19	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.5187	oh my goodness --  i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet.
177_20	0.144	0.856	0.0	-0.2942	forget talking on it in public -- you just can't hear the other person!
177_21	0.0	0.678	0.322	0.5859	on the up-side, the phone has amazing battery life.
177_22	0.0	0.881	0.119	0.1901	i do like this phone overall (would give it a 3.5), but unforutnately, i am returning it.
177_23	0.0	0.678	0.322	0.2263	i was surprised by t-mobile's service.
177_24	0.271	0.729	0.0	-0.7351	i assumed they had exceptional service, but their reception in my area (los angeles) is horrendous.
177_25	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	reason?
177_26	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	they piggy-back on cingular's service.
177_27	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also, their t-zones, although cheap ($ 4.99 / mo.
177_28	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	) never works.
177_29	0.0	0.898	0.102	0.3612	since i received the phone, i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours ".
177_30	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks, when t-zones never worked.
177_31	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	24 hours?
177_32	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	by what time standards -- martian?
177_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	apparently, t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can't keep up with demands.
177_34	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.2263	also, they'd forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service (duh), so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out.
177_35	0.065	0.791	0.144	0.4005	in all fairness, customer reps are very nice, and they (most of them) try hard to answer your questions.
177_36	0.114	0.789	0.097	-0.1624	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they've answered all your questions, even if they didn't, to which they always seem to expect a " yes " answer from you.
177_37	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.1779	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes, but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered (i.e.
177_38	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	me:  " when will my t-zones work?"
177_39	0.329	0.671	0.0	-0.2411	csr:  " i'm not sure ".).
177_40	0.0	0.375	0.625	0.6124	umm, well, thanks for nothing.
177_41	0.094	0.906	0.0	-0.4019	this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he'd answered all my questions (same interaction as i just described), and well...  that was annoying.
177_42	0.09	0.585	0.325	0.6605	t-mobile is trying very hard, and again -- they do have pretty good csr's.
177_43	0.073	0.836	0.091	0.128	however, the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static, to the point where i'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line.
177_44	0.524	0.476	0.0	-0.296	and no t-zones.
177_45	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so what's the point?
177_46	0.198	0.707	0.095	-0.4416	i'm staying with sprint, and though i fear that their csr isn't nearly as good as t-mobile's, the clarity of their reception is exceptional.
177_47	0.0	0.711	0.289	0.7269	i've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i'm okay with my services.
177_48	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	guess all that glitters is not gold.
177_49	0.243	0.625	0.132	-0.3818	it was worth a shot -- too bad it didn't work out.
177_50	0.0	0.248	0.752	0.8439	hope someone else has better luck!
178_1	0.67	0.33	0.0	-0.7269	the phone refused to die.
178_2	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.3612	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile.
178_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine.
178_4	0.074	0.873	0.052	-0.25	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine, i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone.
178_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order.
178_6	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.3612	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard, i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it.

179_4	0.155	0.845	0.0	-0.296	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers.
179_5	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.7027	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity, to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone.
179_6	0.0	0.82	0.18	0.5574	whether you're taking a brisk jog, waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park, you'll be glad you had the fm radio.

180_10	0.194	0.806	0.0	-0.3412	the volume level of the phone is not all that good.
180_11	0.0	0.701	0.299	-0.2529	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear, but not easy to listen to.
180_12	0.085	0.915	0.0	-0.1027	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times.
180_13	0.285	0.715	0.0	-0.1511	the vibration is not top.
180_14	0.122	0.878	0.0	-0.1689	it is a teeny phone, so it is hard to put a big mechanism in.
180_15	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.4215	i don't use the vibration, because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it.
180_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this.
180_17	0.614	0.386	0.0	-0.5809	so it was no loss.

184_3	0.076	0.79	0.134	0.6597	the title says it all...  the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make...  only con i can think of is no camera....  no big deal for the size..  this phone is a winner...
185_1	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.5719	perfect.

185_8	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.6369	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly.
185_9	0.078	0.922	0.0	-0.296	only one complaint about the speakerphone, you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone, not while it is ringing.
185_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the radio:  this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in.
185_11	0.079	0.684	0.237	0.8042	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio, but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone's radio should work perfectly.
185_12	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.4927	tri-band:  one highly beneficial feature of this phone (at least to me) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm, a few in asia.
185_13	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.6003	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly.
185_14	0.252	0.748	0.0	-0.4019	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile.

185_16	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3612	if it worked like that in south africa, i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe.
185_17	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.7096	sold in other parts of the world:  another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world.
185_18	0.18	0.607	0.213	0.1911	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones.
185_19	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store, which are located in many countries in europe.
185_20	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.6522	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service.

185_22	0.0	0.874	0.126	0.1521	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country.
185_23	0.076	0.924	0.0	-0.2263	size and weight:  when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there; it is unbelievably small and oh, so light.
185_24	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.4588	this is a benefit for many reasons; one being just for appearance, your pants won't be bulging with this phone in your pocket.
185_25	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	battery life:  the battery life on this phone is surreal.
185_26	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.4404	it lasts, truly, 7 days on standby.
185_27	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar.
185_28	0.0	0.808	0.192	0.5859	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light.
185_29	0.0	0.849	0.151	0.4927	this phone has many other features, ir,; just to name one, the features above i view as the most beneficial.
185_30	0.11	0.89	0.0	-0.6082	the phone has a few minor inconveniences, but only because it lacks those features, bluetooth and high spend internet, but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do.

186_2	0.0	0.716	0.284	0.8288	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go:  pros:  size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you.
186_3	0.068	0.613	0.319	0.831	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice (check cons) it also doubles as a radio, which is a nice feature when you are bored.
186_4	0.0	0.582	0.418	0.7845	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch.
186_5	0.0	0.648	0.352	0.765	surfing the web on it is nice as well, i just wish there were more wap pages available.
186_6	0.203	0.797	0.0	-0.6249	cons:  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings, there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring.
186_7	0.0	0.914	0.086	0.1779	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out.
186_8	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.4576	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games.

188_2	0.051	0.742	0.206	0.6542	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review, but i actually mean it in earnest.
188_3	0.159	0.667	0.174	0.0772	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply wouldn't perform.
188_4	0.0	0.717	0.283	0.5499	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling, but definitely more functional device.
188_5	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.6124	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department, it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do: to be a wireless telephone.
188_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the reception and sound quality are top-notch.
188_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs, which is an unaccustomed luxury, even with t-mobile service.
188_8	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	i like the size and weight of this little critter.
188_9	0.125	0.875	0.0	-0.3749	i am able to carry it close to my body, in places where other phones are not so easily concealed.
188_10	0.05	0.876	0.074	0.1474	the keys are close together, and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads, but it's not too weird.
188_11	0.083	0.917	0.0	-0.2263	the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing, as many phones use the " # " key instead.
188_12	0.0	0.652	0.348	0.395	but that's not an insurmoutable obstacle.
188_13	0.0	0.538	0.462	0.8225	the screen is bright, easy to see in the daylight, with nice colors.
188_14	0.0	0.744	0.256	0.4754	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones.
188_15	0.161	0.839	0.0	-0.2748	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient.
188_16	0.0	0.967	0.033	0.0772	the menu options appear one at a time, taking up the whole screen, and one has to scroll down one by one, or have memorized where they are in the menu order, to select them by using the number keypad.
188_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	thumbs down on that one.
188_18	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the vibrate setting is loud!
188_19	0.115	0.699	0.186	0.2755	so loud, really, that it doesn't work terribly well as a silent ringer option.
188_20	0.083	0.841	0.075	0.1531	but, then again, the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office, when i was already out on the street...  which was a good thing, because i realized i had forgotten my phone...  other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack.
188_21	0.102	0.679	0.219	0.8922	i'd like a camera phone, but i'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls...  pros:  - light, compact design  - solid, high-quality construction  - well-backlit keypad  - outstanding signal reception  - excellent sound quality  - bright, visible screen  - speakerphone  - very long-lasting battery life  cons:  - some features in the user interface  - no voice activated dialing (what were they thinking  - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones.

192_11	0.0	0.849	0.151	0.4927	battery life is very good, i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so.

192_13	0.129	0.871	0.0	-0.5106	the volume key can be hard to press, but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw, perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call.

192_15	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3802	please!
192_16	0.0	0.708	0.292	0.5106	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software?
193_1	0.0	0.729	0.271	0.3832	slightly better than average phone in its class.
193_2	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.3182	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year (right after the release contract is over).
193_3	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.5423	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone.
193_4	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.6361	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends:  sound quality:  the most important thing for me is sound quality.
193_5	0.146	0.662	0.192	0.1779	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception.
193_6	0.0	0.898	0.102	0.3832	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone, the motorolla t720 series, and the sony ericsson t610 series.
193_7	0.0	0.849	0.151	0.6249	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you don't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk.
193_8	0.0	0.711	0.289	0.6461	overall design:  i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets.
193_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest.
193_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small.
193_11	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.6705	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a) you wont scratch your screens / keys b) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys.
193_12	0.0	0.595	0.405	0.7579	ease of use:  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu?
193_14	0.0	0.564	0.436	0.4754	that is a very nice feature.
193_15	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.4215	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones (t610, t720i).
193_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the sony ericsson phone (t610) has the most whistles and bells, but is also the hardest to use.
193_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	battery:  the nokia, samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you don't talk too much.
193_18	0.149	0.851	0.0	-0.5423	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day (although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life).
193_19	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	features:  the t610 has the most functionality hands down.
193_20	0.0	0.795	0.205	0.4754	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice.
193_22	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the t610 can also compose music, a feature which most won't use.
193_23	0.256	0.744	0.0	-0.4754	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless.
193_24	0.0	0.898	0.102	0.3832	it also has a stock tracking app built in (also useless) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics (currency, length, area, etc).
193_25	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.5994	the s105 (samsung) has a beautiful big display (65,000 colors), and i can't say much about the motorolla.
193_26	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	all these phones have color screens, polymorphic tones, and are internet ready.
193_27	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.7876	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords (thats number of different instruments which it can play) i think, the samsung i think have 15, i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones.
193_28	0.0	0.819	0.181	0.6486	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop.
193_29	0.263	0.508	0.229	-0.1027	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft.
193_30	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.3832	oh well..  overall this is a slightly better than average phone.
193_31	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.7964	both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610.  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more.
193_32	0.0	0.726	0.274	0.5994	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year.
193_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610.
193_34	0.0	0.962	0.038	0.2846	they are all free if you get a new account anyway, but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling.

195_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	here's a hint: go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth.
195_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite, i.e.
195_7	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.765	free ringtones from midi files, free graphics from any picture on your computer, and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games.

200_10	0.2	0.714	0.086	-0.6486	so, i recomend it, but not for those that have any hearing troubles, or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places (which is annoying, by the way.)

204_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing, this phone does not have voice dialing.
204_11	0.178	0.822	0.0	-0.5023	the keypad is a decent size, but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press.
204_12	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4404	however, the battery life is good enough you shouldn't be overly concerned with turning this phone off.
204_13	0.24	0.76	0.0	-0.6249	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control.
204_14	0.188	0.706	0.106	-0.34	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone.
204_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia, so standard headphones will not work.

205_9	0.0	0.598	0.402	0.9337	it has great battery life, fm radio, excellent signal, hands free speakerphone (which i have to say is probably my favorite function) and downloadable java apps.

205_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again.
205_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but for now this will do.
205_13	0.062	0.783	0.154	0.5187	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone, but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam.

206_4	0.0	0.93	0.07	0.3612	i went to an at &amp;#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads.
206_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop, which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email.

208_9	0.074	0.742	0.184	0.6124	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range, or like me, do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones.

209_2	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better.
209_3	0.0	0.594	0.406	0.6249	the radio feature has superb sound quality.
209_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i've compared this phone to others such as 6100, siemens sl55.

209_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	one thing that i found out recently is that you don't need t-zones from tmobile to go online.
209_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data, meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps (with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference).
209_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net, being able to download pics and ringtones (not java apps, you need t-zones for that).
209_14	0.06	0.797	0.143	0.6144	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans.

210_5	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.3989	very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for, and one that has not yet been mentioned: using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port!
210_6	0.072	0.928	0.0	-0.1027	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account.
210_7	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.2144	yes it is 56k speed, but the functionality is what you are paying for.
210_8	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.7073	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable (49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com) press dial up on my laptop (by the way it is a mac pb 1gz.

210_10	0.096	0.819	0.085	-0.079	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls (real estate broker software) very well at all.
210_11	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.7579	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots ".
210_12	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.2732	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing.

211_3	0.1	0.852	0.048	-0.3404	also, if i want a family plan, which mean i need tw phones on a plan...  so how can i do that... aren't that free for two after the rebates.

211_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	...
212_1	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	don't have the phone just commenting.
212_2	0.173	0.827	0.0	-0.3182	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing.
212_3	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.1779	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon &amp; t-mobile and nokia.
212_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone.
212_5	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.5719	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset.
212_6	0.351	0.476	0.173	-0.4576	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing.
212_7	0.437	0.563	0.0	-0.3241	i don't really like bounce.
212_8	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.4404	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones.
212_9	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.4404	battery life is good for a phone of this size.
212_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but anyway, the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing.
212_11	0.0	0.268	0.732	0.8481	great screen and great sound.
212_12	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.5267	ok, everybody loves the fm radio in this, but you want a cell phone first, right?
212_13	0.0	0.382	0.618	0.7964	the 6610 excels as a cell phone, thank god.
212_14	0.0	0.696	0.304	0.8882	the voice quality is very good, and it gets great reception (that is, in places where you get t-mobile coverage, which is not that good; see below).
212_15	0.0	0.678	0.322	0.6901	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright, and commands are very responsive.
212_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons.
212_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad, which imho is totally unnecessary.
212_18	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.3612	this model does have the traditional key arrangement, it's just that they are really close to one another, and have unconventional shapes, so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands.
212_19	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.3182	(to be fair, the same can be said about many korean imports, and the nokia's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans.)
212_20	0.111	0.704	0.186	0.3612	other than that, this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips.
212_21	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	finally, i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier.
212_22	0.166	0.834	0.0	-0.5256	their network coverage is very sporadic, and the network always seems overloaded, resulting in very unpleasant calling experience.
212_23	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&amp;t, go with the other carriers.
213_1	0.153	0.278	0.569	0.7906	great phone, great service, no voice dialing.
213_2	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.6249	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone, and what a great phone it is.
213_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when i first saw the 6610, i thought it was too small.
213_4	0.0	0.764	0.236	0.5719	after using it, i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket.
213_5	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.8196	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder, but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included.
213_6	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.3421	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all, unless dialing a number.
213_7	0.076	0.846	0.078	0.0129	unfortunately, the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone, but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming.

213_17	0.0	0.954	0.046	0.0772	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries, with multiple phone number per entry, so you can program your boss's home, work and cellphone numbers all under one contact.

213_19	0.068	0.795	0.136	0.4835	the gprs connection is sometimes slow, and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain, but the other t-zones applications are quite useful.

213_31	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.4748	different people have different needs, of course, but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive.

214_4	0.176	0.692	0.132	-0.34	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have.
214_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it's a " worldphone " and can be used in europe, etc.
214_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yet they've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone, including italian, german, and dutch.
214_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile's services, because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network.
214_8	0.066	0.934	0.0	-0.296	therefore, if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card, even if you unlock the phone, there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet.

215_6	0.197	0.803	0.0	-0.4019	however, the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality.
215_7	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.3412	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier.
215_8	0.255	0.745	0.0	-0.3401	when talking the voice is not very clear.
215_9	0.0	0.606	0.394	0.5023	but, i would definately recommend this phone.

216_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	while, there are flaws with the machine, the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability.
216_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there.
216_5	0.032	0.735	0.233	0.8882	like it's predecessor, the quickly revised nx, this player boasts a decent size and weight, a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags, and excellent sound (widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business).
216_6	0.0	0.711	0.289	0.6908	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger, now-blue backlit screen, which is infinitely better.
216_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	further, the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3.
216_8	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.4927	this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties.
216_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short, but only by a bit.
216_10	0.16	0.757	0.082	-0.1899	yes the ipod is smaller, but not $ 200 worth, which is the premium you'll pay for an equivalent capacity model.
216_11	0.043	0.848	0.109	0.2502	yes, the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late, but sure-as-hell isn't worth the $ 200 premium (unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe).
216_12	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.4939	for me, i'll save that cash for another purchase.

217_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that takes up half the space of mp3's.
217_7	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.2023	that's important because i have a lot of music.

217_10	0.0	0.4	0.6	0.8402	transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy.
217_11	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.7188	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good.
217_12	0.62	0.38	0.0	-0.5994	only 1 problem, no accessories... yet.
217_13	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3387	i hope it's because it's new and they are not out yet, but being without a remote is hard.
217_14	0.0	0.738	0.262	0.4927	they player's interface itself is also very easy to use.
217_15	0.095	0.678	0.226	0.4404	can't complain and i recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon.

218_4	0.118	0.718	0.164	0.626	pros:  software is easy to use (although redhat software is better, but costs money)  much cheaper than i-pod good looking player (beautiful blue back-lit screen) if you've read about the player, some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on, but this is good because the face doesn't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate  no issues as of yet  cons:  you're going to need to buy new headphones, the stock ones suck  hopefully, this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod.
218_5	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.0772	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd, mooooooh, then buy the i-pod.

219_4	0.054	0.66	0.287	0.7684	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well.
219_5	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.2732	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod.

220_2	0.152	0.848	0.0	-0.4973	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can't, i'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars.
220_3	0.0	0.513	0.487	0.2263	it's worth it.
220_4	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.2755	i personally don't like apple or their business practices (screwing resellers, customers and employees left and right) so i shopped around for something else.
220_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player, i knew i had found what i was looking for.
220_6	0.155	0.845	0.0	-0.296	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price: i found both.
220_7	0.0	0.652	0.348	0.6597	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time.
220_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size, so you have to wonder just how much apple's markup is anyway!
220_9	0.0	0.81	0.19	0.3291	the sound is excellent, but a tip: get a real pair of headphones.
220_10	0.107	0.756	0.137	0.1635	you won't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
220_11	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.4199	the controls are on the side instead of on the front, which i like, because that's where my thumb is when i hold the thing!
220_12	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.4588	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad.
220_13	0.0	0.757	0.243	0.5927	it could be a little bit bigger, but it's easy to get used to.
220_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the screen may be a little smaller, but it is very readable and doesn't come in the overused blue.
220_15	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.2235	it doesn't have firewire, not a real complaint since most windows users don't generally have firewire cards themselves.
220_16	0.087	0.721	0.192	0.4939	(i would have appreciated having a firewire plug, however)  the included leather pouch is a big plus: it actually protects the unit well, something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices.
220_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	other plusses: changable battery, loads of presets for environments, decent construction, still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod.

220_23	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.2755	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment, aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make.
220_24	0.0	0.695	0.305	0.6588	overall: small, sounds great, and less expensive than apple's overpriced ipod!
220_25	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	(batteries last longer too!)
221_1	0.0	0.484	0.516	0.4926	way better than a i-pod!

221_4	0.0	0.932	0.068	0.2263	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models (almost $ 500 for a 30gb), and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money.
221_5	0.039	0.697	0.264	0.8432	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player.

221_7	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.7003	the music is easy to get to (all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online, then you can do the same with the zen.
221_8	0.0	0.793	0.207	0.7453	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night, but dim enough so it doesn't blind you when you stare too long.
221_9	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.9294	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away, with easy to use and understand features, software that is simple to understand and use, and a great sound (which is all that matters in a mp3 player).

222_9	0.152	0.848	0.0	-0.4784	the only downside i see is that it doesn't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad, it has to be done from the computer.

223_15	0.0	0.591	0.409	0.8658	on the positive side, the sound of the player is pretty good, once you have everything configured.

230_2	0.0	0.947	0.053	0.2382	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced, but it's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods (although, the ipod is still way over priced).

230_5	0.0	0.91	0.09	0.5187	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players (the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive).
230_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the ipod uses a smaller (and more expensive) drive (1.8 ").
230_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120, the rio karma, and the philips hdd100.
230_8	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.7003	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as (and better in some areas) the ipod.
230_9	0.0	0.881	0.119	0.3182	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400.  that's a huge difference... especially in this price range.

230_12	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.5719	i gave the zen 5 stars because it's excellent for the class that it is in and it's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class.
230_13	0.0	0.88	0.12	0.4588	my personal favorite is the karma (i currently own a karma, a zen usb 2.0, a philips hdd100, and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder).

231_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	having 4000 or so mp3s, i never got more than 500 transfered.
231_4	0.102	0.82	0.078	-0.1531	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter, but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling.
231_5	0.123	0.877	0.0	-0.5216	size - bigger than the ipod  software - music match jukebox isn't the greatest, the search funtion isn't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut.

231_9	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.5927	the navigion on it can be a little quirky, but still operates better than the zen's did.
231_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the ipod is also an attractable piece, being lightweight and small.
231_11	0.0	0.525	0.475	0.8969	the casing scratches a little easy, but the glove cases work great to protect against this.
231_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	sound quality was the same between the two, but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features.
231_13	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.6115	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase.

233_2	0.131	0.869	0.0	-0.3089	first, the cons... a tad bulky... not the most asthetic looking player... and doesn't support a folder stucture.
233_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the pro...  way less expensive than the ipod.
233_4	0.05	0.721	0.229	0.8271	my opinions:  personally, i don't understand all the complaints about the interface...  i find it pretty easy to use... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx (on the pc)...  it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list.
233_5	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.3818	meaning i don't have to manually clear the list, and then load the new list.
233_6	0.069	0.899	0.031	-0.4215	the cons aren't really a big deal to me... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files... no folder structure... and it's based on the title of the songs... many of my songs where seperated into folders (on the pc)... and a few had same titles... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i didn't have any that might be the same as another.
233_7	0.0	0.952	0.048	0.3612	and man... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title..  and since the current language selection was english (even though i think only the menu supports chinese, and not the track info)... all it saw were "?
233_8	0.0	0.929	0.071	0.0772	and even though the songs had different names in chinese..  if it had the same number of "?
233_9	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.1531	then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of "?
233_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	...  buyer beware!
233_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly (maybe this applies to other players too, and not just the nomad, i don't know).
233_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i would've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand.
233_13	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.6597	not counting the time i spent editing the songs (i suppose i should've done it anyway on my pc) the transfer was pretty painless.
233_14	0.056	0.944	0.0	-0.25	once you start sending files, it'll continue until it's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song... at which point you can skip, skip all, replace, replace all, or cancel.
233_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and go from there... if you chose one of the " all " options, then you don't need to do anything until it's done.
233_16	0.098	0.902	0.0	-0.34	in two transfer batches (first was english songs, then foreign languages), it didn't come up with any errors (aside the duplicate name i mentioned).
233_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so i don't know what the previous review that couldn't do more than 30 songs is talking about.
233_18	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	of course, unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23.
233_19	0.0	0.776	0.224	0.438	00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too.
233_20	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
233_21	0.069	0.931	0.0	-0.2144	the mediasource itself was flaky... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour (the crash didn't require a reboot)... but after another reboot, it hasn't crashed since.

234_5	0.189	0.811	0.0	-0.5664	i'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad, or the software that comes with the unit.
234_6	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4927	both are very easy to learn &amp; use, and intuitive enough for even a novice.
234_7	0.382	0.618	0.0	-0.7003	besides user error (surprise, surprise), it's hard to imagine people having trouble with either.
234_8	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.4939	ripping &amp; transferring tunes is basic, and pretty fast (even on a 1.1 usb).
234_9	0.056	0.815	0.129	0.533	people also have complained about the case not having a window, but that's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection.
234_10	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	it's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you're listening to.
234_11	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.7506	the sound quality is excellent (and i'm fussy with that stuff), the unit looks cool, screen is bright and easy to read, and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod (besides the price, but everyone knows that).
234_12	0.0	0.773	0.227	0.6124	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well (sound presets, navigating options, playlists, etc).
234_13	0.0	0.83	0.17	0.5411	i just put it on " shuffle ", sit back, and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer!
234_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the only thing i'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing.
234_15	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.3362	my " fast forward " button works, but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go.
234_16	0.07	0.699	0.232	0.573	not an urgent issue, as it still works...  all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well.
234_17	0.213	0.787	0.0	-0.4019	i'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road.
234_18	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.8126	but i've already emailed creative tech support about it, and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary...  we'll see if i need them to.
234_19	0.0	0.858	0.142	0.1655	sure, it's a little bigger than the ipod, but not by much.
234_20	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway.

234_26	0.0	0.549	0.451	0.6249	bottom line... great product, unbeatable price.
234_27	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.5983	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb (got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa... thanks amazon!)

235_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	unlike my 3 other mp3 players, this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks.
235_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you don't have tags, it'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders.
235_5	0.255	0.745	0.0	-0.2617	it's a shame, but mine is going back.

236_4	0.089	0.835	0.076	-0.09	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go.
236_5	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.4404	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift.

236_11	0.538	0.462	0.0	-0.5423	that's probably a bad thing.
236_12	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.6652	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well.
236_13	0.138	0.862	0.0	-0.34	it was always after it finished a process or something, so it didn't cause any file errors.
236_14	0.187	0.813	0.0	-0.4576	now that i have all my music on it there hasn't been any more problems.
236_15	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4404	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it.

236_17	0.0	0.895	0.105	0.4019	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides.
236_18	0.139	0.721	0.139	0.0	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i don't figure out a way to break it.

236_20	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.6115	all in all though i'm very happy with my new mp3 player.
236_21	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.6428	i'll admit that i'd own an ipod if i had money to burn, but for the money this is a much better buy.

237_10	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable.

237_12	0.199	0.619	0.182	-0.126	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it's that good!

238_3	0.0	0.927	0.073	0.2263	nice palm sized unit, somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you're not going to try &amp; jog with it or something.
238_4	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.7964	all reviews i've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed (ipod, archos, dell, samsung).
238_5	0.0	0.676	0.324	0.6511	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative.
238_6	0.191	0.738	0.07	-0.7954	i've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it &amp; it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio, but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment.
238_7	0.375	0.625	0.0	-0.6597	dislikes  - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones.
238_8	0.165	0.633	0.203	0.1531	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap &amp; is uncomfortable to use.
238_9	0.12	0.655	0.225	0.4091	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical  - included creative software is pretty poor.
238_10	0.0	0.63	0.37	0.8316	red chair's notmad explorer is great &amp; recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software.
238_11	0.0	0.525	0.475	0.9787	note: this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase, but worth it  likes  - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price  - best in class sound  - large easy readable screen
239_1	0.865	0.135	0.0	-0.7506	depressingly poor quality.
239_2	0.056	0.866	0.078	0.0772	after receiving the box from amazon, i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours, after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0.  the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software, which failed, as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards, whatever.
239_3	0.098	0.82	0.082	-0.1189	i then installed the software manually instead, after having to click past about 5 windows of " please register with us so we can spam your inbox ".
239_4	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.6249	at this time, i decided to turn the player on, and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music, one of which is a childhood favorite, bach's air.
239_5	0.144	0.458	0.399	0.5994	i tried to play the song three times, with no success.
239_6	0.174	0.781	0.045	-0.4829	it would either not play the song at all, or skip wildly, no matter that the unit was resting on my desk.
239_7	0.034	0.867	0.099	0.4939	well, maybe that particular song was just corrupt, so i tried to upload some of my own, after four attempts, at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot, i managed to upload an album, which albeit was surprisingly fast, however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs, the nomad again froze up and refused to work.
239_8	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.296	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist, before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon's product return page.
239_9	0.209	0.791	0.0	-0.2755	needless to say, i wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing this product.
239_10	0.255	0.623	0.122	-0.6757	had there been strange noises, or obvious defects, i would have accepted a replacement, but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches.

242_5	0.138	0.713	0.149	0.0451	the software is somewhat nice to look at, using it is not the easiest.
242_6	0.164	0.773	0.063	-0.4767	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred, you will become frustrated quite quickly.
242_7	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.4404	you are better off deleting it, re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player.
242_8	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.743	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0.  it is great sounding, even with the supplied earbuds.
242_9	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.4404	i must have differing preferences than others here, as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony's that i thought sounded good on other players.

242_13	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.4019	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3's in which i would have never purchased the cd.

242_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd.

242_17	0.556	0.444	0.0	-0.3612	this is ridiculous.
242_18	0.0	0.809	0.191	0.5106	to me this alludes to the manufacturer's confidence that the product will last for a year.
242_19	0.19	0.735	0.076	-0.5859	buy the re-seller's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later, after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time (probably sooner than later).
242_20	0.294	0.706	0.0	-0.3612	the scroll wheel, to be blunt, sucks.
242_21	0.217	0.783	0.0	-0.3612	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection.
242_22	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.4404	the interface used could be better designed.
242_23	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.0772	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want.
242_24	0.247	0.685	0.068	-0.7579	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this, there would be hell to pay, not to mention the ridicule from my peers.
242_25	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and the case, how did this ever make it out of quality control.
242_27	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the screen is covered, so to make any new selections you have to open it.
242_28	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls, especially the scroll wheel.
242_29	0.115	0.885	0.0	-0.296	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet, so you have to live with it.
242_30	0.086	0.914	0.0	-0.5621	despite the things that i have listed so far, i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work, to the gym, in the car, etc..  however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times.
242_31	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music.
242_32	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the files are there, but i could not access the player without removing the battery, waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery.
242_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call.
242_34	0.0	0.927	0.073	0.2023	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over.
242_35	0.0	0.749	0.251	0.3995	could not stop it, could not get out of the " now playing " screen.
242_36	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	again had to remove the battery.
242_37	0.0	0.869	0.131	0.2755	there have been other occurrences of locking, but i will not bore you with the details.
242_38	0.11	0.89	0.0	-0.2755	quite simply, the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time.
242_39	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.3818	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time, upon powering it up it starts on the " now playing " screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before.
242_40	0.228	0.772	0.0	-0.5499	i haven't quite figured this one out yet, but it is probably operator error.
242_41	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.5927	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured, but since i received it as a gift i now have this one.
242_42	0.224	0.776	0.0	-0.5994	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology.
242_43	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and we all know about the rush to market on new products.
242_44	0.158	0.76	0.082	-0.3818	i have had this player for 2 weeks, i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit.
242_45	0.0	0.895	0.105	0.4019	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so (from the purchase date) to obtain one.
242_46	0.171	0.727	0.103	-0.4914	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it, since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous!
243_1	0.0	0.213	0.787	0.5719	excellent product.
243_2	0.0	0.598	0.402	0.7506	this is my second creative labs mp3 player, and it is definitely a fine product.
243_3	0.132	0.868	0.0	-0.5423	first let me give you the bad things:  1. the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod, and it weighs a little bit more.

243_7	0.0	0.585	0.415	0.7496	the player's software is very easy to use and very good.
243_8	0.0	0.659	0.341	0.6908	compared to musicmatch, the software has a better filing system and easier to use.
243_9	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4404	to keep it short, this is cheaper, and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod.

245_3	0.113	0.887	0.0	-0.4215	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance (less than 2 ft).
245_4	0.077	0.923	0.0	-0.5423	if it were not for that i would have given it 4.  pros:  1) price / gb of storage  2) storage capacity  3) user replaceable battery  cons:  1) fragile (i broke the 1st one within 10 days)  2) scroll button / switch  3) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing.
245_5	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.4215	features that would have been nice:  1) fm receiver - some models out there have this.

245_21	0.096	0.393	0.511	0.891	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation.
245_22	0.0	0.549	0.451	0.6249	storage:  the storage capacity is great.

245_28	0.0	0.802	0.198	0.4939	the higher the number the better the quality (less data compression is used) and the larger the file size.
245_29	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.3612	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps.
245_30	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.1531	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player.
245_31	0.072	0.885	0.043	-0.2263	if you're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end (typically 128 is considered close to cd quality).
245_32	0.0	0.661	0.339	0.6249	price:  the price compared to the ipod is great.
245_33	0.061	0.877	0.061	0.0	price, along with the replaceable battery (which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad.

245_38	0.303	0.697	0.0	-0.5824	but for now it appears that this player doesn't play well with itunes.
245_39	0.292	0.708	0.0	-0.5106	scroll bar:  the scroll bar is a bit of a pain.
245_40	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items.

245_53	0.0	0.72	0.28	0.6808	in addition, you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player.
245_54	0.0	0.267	0.733	0.6705	this is pretty cool.
245_55	0.257	0.628	0.115	-0.4033	sound:  the sound from the player is ok.  i was a little disappointed in the low end.
245_56	0.0	0.795	0.205	0.2023	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended.
245_57	0.0	0.71	0.29	0.6486	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base.
245_58	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected.
245_59	0.0	0.819	0.181	0.6486	it's probably good for the health of your ears, however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range (and my hearing is fine).

246_4	0.05	0.731	0.219	0.7269	this thing is great, i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records.

246_6	0.039	0.722	0.239	0.886	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on, but creative did a good job with this, as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years.

247_5	0.0	0.715	0.285	0.4927	for the price and features it is really good.
247_6	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4404	one thing, before buying this player i have called the creative tech.
247_7	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.6597	support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes.
247_8	0.204	0.37	0.426	0.34	sure enough there is no such ability.
247_9	0.067	0.849	0.085	0.1376	not sure, if customer rep. did not know the product exactly, it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear.
247_10	0.08	0.697	0.224	0.4404	in any case, navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders.
247_11	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.296	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre, no other division.
247_12	0.0	0.799	0.201	0.8074	creative is talking about updating it via firmware, however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players, looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates, not too much of new features.
247_13	0.194	0.806	0.0	-0.3412	the software, which comes with player is not good at all.
247_14	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work.
247_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad.
247_16	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3612	notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product.
247_17	0.0	0.604	0.396	0.8957	transfer files is easy using notmad, however again, would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver, rca lyra and some other.
247_18	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4404	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables.
247_19	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.6369	artist, album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player, and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory.
247_20	0.08	0.739	0.181	0.4201	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive, so better organization is required.
247_21	0.0	0.903	0.097	0.4215	the bottom line, i'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver.
248_1	0.0	0.67	0.33	0.8126	the bundled software blows, yes...... but i heard of notmad explorer (http://redchairsoftware.com) from the creative tech support people.
248_2	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4588	i downloaded the trial version, and after less than 10 minutes of using it, decided it was well worth the price.
248_3	0.265	0.478	0.256	-0.0534	so yes, as with all software bundled with creative products, it was useless and ugly.
248_4	0.0	0.522	0.478	0.7506	for once, though, this 3rd party software is excellent.

250_3	0.0	0.637	0.363	0.9413	the sound is excellent, the battery life is excellent, the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent, and finally the price, $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod, is excellent.
250_4	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3612	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style, size, and ease of use.
250_5	0.0	0.786	0.214	0.7002	the nomad is not ugly, it is not that big, it comfortably fits in my pocket, or heavy, and the controls are not hard to get used to.
250_6	0.187	0.742	0.071	-0.4703	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance, also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing.
250_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i only have one question, when i add tracks to my nomad, via nomad explorer, they are automatically put in alphebetical order, rather than album order.
250_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is this possible to fix, if so how, if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this?
250_9	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering.

251_5	0.108	0.762	0.13	0.5391	a) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily, and it definately wouldnt survive a drop  b) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display  c) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said  d) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate, crashes frequently, screwed my music library up, doesnt work with mp4s, the list goes on and on  e) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage  f) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash, you want something that has the asthetics bit down, of course  so...  im taking mine back tomorrow morning, and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead.

254_13	0.0	0.591	0.409	0.8402	btw, be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly, as this will ensure a great organization.
254_14	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.2732	- the unit itself its well structured, with just the buttons you need and none you don't.
254_15	0.188	0.699	0.113	-0.3378	as often mentioned, the scroll tab is average, however, not difficult to use or horrible.
254_16	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.34	structurally, everything is secure and it won't fall apart on you.
254_17	0.0	0.729	0.271	0.6369	the screen is large, defined, and easy to read, and the silver unit is naturally cool.
254_18	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4019	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax, and customization.
254_19	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.7579	- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out (as all lithium batteries do), you will be able to buy another easily.
254_20	0.113	0.887	0.0	-0.1027	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement.
254_21	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also, the nomad's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy.
254_22	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	- equipment included is average, but that isn't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for.
254_23	0.191	0.677	0.132	-0.2382	the case is strong and stylish, but unfortunately lacks a window (now a big deal).
254_24	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the headphone earbuds are average, so just use your regular pair instead.
254_25	0.0	0.638	0.362	0.5267	conclusion:  this player is an ideal purchase.
254_26	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.5023	there isn't need to get in details again, but just remember it rocks because: price, sound, ease of use, and features.
254_27	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know, and you will not be dissapointed.
255_1	0.0	0.476	0.524	0.5106	impressive with few flaws.
255_2	0.212	0.691	0.097	-0.5429	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt.
255_3	0.257	0.576	0.167	-0.1796	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player.
255_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	on my main computer the software did not work right.
255_5	0.108	0.763	0.129	0.1134	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all.
255_6	0.165	0.671	0.165	0.0	i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself.
255_7	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.6597	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic.
255_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work, because it works on all the other computers i have.
255_9	0.131	0.777	0.092	-0.2023	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost.
256_1	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6249	awesome.
256_2	0.0	0.738	0.262	0.4927	i'm very pleased with my zx so here's a quick review.
256_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	first there's the unit itself.
256_4	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.438	it is small overall, bigger than the ipod, but keep in mind that this is because different, less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx.
256_5	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.5423	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod, however it compromises a bit of the unit's size in doing so.
256_6	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.7501	the lcd is larger than the previous model, the nx, and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx's green backlight did.
256_7	0.157	0.633	0.211	0.4215	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me, however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate.
256_8	0.131	0.476	0.393	0.6597	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product.
256_9	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.6808	the included eax support is useful at times, especially when you listen to a variety of genres, as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle.
256_10	0.169	0.831	0.0	-0.7109	the environmental audio, however, is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it (i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates.)
256_11	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.6908	the signal to noise ratio (the ratio of detectable, useful data to unusable garbage in, say, a radio wave; a larger stn ratio is better) is nice and high at 98 decibles, and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods.
256_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the software hasn't been a hassle for me at all.
256_13	0.113	0.887	0.0	-0.3182	i ignored the instruction booklet (as i do with any product) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes.
256_14	0.0	0.9	0.1	0.2732	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well, and she is of average computer competence.
256_15	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.4588	the less computer-saavy might find apple's software a bit friendlier, though (i use it at a friend's house and it does do a lot more for you.)
256_16	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.5574	lastly, the price is fantastic:  i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx, compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120.
256_17	0.158	0.766	0.077	-0.6705	for prospective buyers, i would warn of the following: 1) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible, as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable (this applies to earbuds in general,) and 2) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them, that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves.
256_18	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.6908	if you want great sound quality, don't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte, don't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users, and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount, then i would suggest the zen xtra for you.
257_1	0.0	0.141	0.859	0.7269	it's pretty good.
257_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it!!
257_3	0.253	0.747	0.0	-0.9038	(i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead).
257_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need.
257_5	0.135	0.801	0.064	-0.3818	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs (reviewers figures)  i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems.
257_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds.
257_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds.
257_8	0.13	0.449	0.421	0.7043	usb 2.0 - very fast  yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap, replace them.
257_9	0.0	0.652	0.348	0.7869	but the sound is very good (and loud) and works well on my portable speakers.
257_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world (and is quite small).
257_11	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.3804	it looks very cool, and seems quite small to me and very light.
257_12	0.348	0.496	0.156	-0.4019	the scroll button seems ok, i have no problems with it.
257_13	0.0	0.556	0.444	0.4927	i am very pleased so far.
257_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format (200 cd's).
257_15	0.495	0.25	0.255	-0.4309	so far so good, no problems, no conversions.
257_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	very simple to use.
257_17	0.0	0.76	0.24	0.6249	the reason it does not get 5 stars  1) a spare battery would have been great.
257_18	0.163	0.667	0.17	0.0258	2) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it.
257_19	0.184	0.721	0.095	0.4386	3) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer, like some players  all in all suprisingly easy to use.
258_1	0.0	0.494	0.506	0.6249	a great player for the price.
258_2	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.5927	summary:  lots of flaws, but exceptional sound quality, hd size, and price make it a good buy.
258_3	0.0	0.581	0.419	0.7579	pros:  excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox.
258_4	0.12	0.656	0.224	0.4404	there was no distortion and it sounded great, especially with eax environmental audio enabled.
258_5	0.162	0.838	0.0	-0.5267	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk, so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad.
258_6	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.4215	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software.
258_7	0.109	0.698	0.194	0.2732	however, it doesn't register instantly as a hard drive like other players.
258_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you have to install the software to the computer you're transferring to, instead of just connecting it with a usb connection.
258_9	0.0	0.641	0.359	0.4215	this would have been much easier.
258_10	0.069	0.931	0.0	-0.1027	the nomad can hold any type of file, not just mp3, so you can use it as a portable hard disk.
258_11	0.0	0.758	0.242	0.4927	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer.
258_12	0.208	0.623	0.17	-0.0935	this almost made it worth the price alone.
258_13	0.0	0.798	0.202	0.5106	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer, and then transfer them to a friend's.
258_14	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.3182	huge storage space - even at 320kbs, you can store a ton of songs on this thing.
258_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	30gb is more than enough for most people.
258_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers.
258_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file.
258_18	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs.
258_19	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	cons:  navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs.
258_20	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.6249	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags, and if you've downloaded your songs off the internet, many probably don't.
258_21	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.4215	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system.
258_22	0.0	0.862	0.138	0.34	you can't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it.
258_23	0.105	0.895	0.0	-0.4019	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox, it dumps all of them into a single folder, and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
258_24	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	fm receiver - it has none.
258_25	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.4215	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations.
258_26	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether.
258_27	0.072	0.928	0.0	-0.1027	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners.
258_28	0.101	0.792	0.107	0.024	the player feels very delicate, as if i'm holding an actual hard drive.
258_29	0.179	0.821	0.0	-0.2411	i'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet.
258_30	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	as a portable player, it should feel a bit more durable.
258_31	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.2023	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable.
258_32	0.127	0.873	0.0	-0.1531	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to.
258_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this is not a player you can take jogging.
258_34	0.162	0.638	0.199	0.119	the songs don't play one after another like on a cd.
258_35	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.2023	you have to add them to the playing list.
258_36	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.34	i can't simply bring up my entire list of songs, click play, and then hit next.
258_37	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.34	you have to add all the songs to a play list.
258_38	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.4215	there is probably an easier way to do this, i just haven't found it yet.
258_39	0.394	0.606	0.0	-0.3818	software - the software is crap.
258_40	0.0	0.621	0.379	0.7269	i use it for ripping cds, which it does a pretty good job of.
258_41	0.369	0.631	0.0	-0.4767	otherwise, it is difficult to figure out and awkward.
258_42	0.18	0.668	0.152	0.1352	like most people, i don't want to read the instructions, i just want to use it.
258_43	0.104	0.896	0.0	-0.1027	even after reading some of the instructions, it's still hard to figure out.
258_44	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.3612	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer, " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet.
258_45	0.216	0.784	0.0	-0.296	no line out jack - as i said, there is none.
258_46	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack.
258_47	0.0	0.866	0.134	0.5719	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter, but you don't get the quality from a true line out jack.
258_48	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.5719	it sounds decent, but i would estimate you get maybe 80% of the quality that you would from a true line out jack.
258_49	0.348	0.652	0.0	-0.1531	controls are a bit awkward.
258_50	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the controls definately took some getting used to.
258_51	0.138	0.862	0.0	-0.3412	it wasn't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman.
258_52	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was.
258_53	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.4215	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included.
258_54	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.0772	i want to have instant access to the volume, not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it.
258_55	0.783	0.217	0.0	-0.5574	crappy headphones.
258_56	0.394	0.606	0.0	-0.3818	the included earbuds were uncomfortable.
258_57	0.0	0.581	0.419	0.7574	i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones.
258_58	0.41	0.59	0.0	-0.7133	difficult navigation - i won't necessarily say " difficult, " but i don't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate.
258_59	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.0772	it is a bit cumbersome, and i can't get to the songs i want as quickly.
258_60	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i think this is it's biggest flaw.
258_61	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes.
258_62	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4404	up, down, left, and right would have given me better control.
258_63	0.044	0.915	0.041	-0.0289	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long (which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through), it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and won't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it.
258_64	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case.
258_65	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.4404	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen, and if the button didn't cover up the ac jack.
258_66	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that way i could keep it in the case all the time.
258_67	0.093	0.8	0.107	0.1027	as it stands now, the case is pretty useless unless you're packing the player up for travel, or if you load up all your songs beforehand.
258_68	0.123	0.877	0.0	-0.2732	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though.
258_69	0.0	0.748	0.252	0.5719	overall, i feel that it's a decent buy, and am happy that i own it.
258_70	0.153	0.639	0.208	0.4019	i am willing to overlook it's problems to get superior sound quality and low price, although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement.
259_1	0.335	0.502	0.163	-0.4678	good for the money, but software is awful.
259_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	after looking over multiple large mp3 players, i decided to get this one.
259_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for the price and size and features, you can't beat the price.
259_4	0.041	0.959	0.0	-0.1027	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins, accesses files or does antyhing.
259_5	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.2382	i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection, whihc is a plus, but then again it is only speculation.
259_6	0.0	0.715	0.285	0.4927	the buttons and interface are very easy to use.
259_7	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.4927	simple click buttons, back buttons volume and display are very easy to read, access and use.
259_8	0.307	0.693	0.0	-0.5499	but the major problem i had was with the software.
259_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you are not able to simply import files, but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them.
259_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the instructions that come with it don't explain how to make things simple.
259_11	0.228	0.772	0.0	-0.616	the quick sync isn't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just isn't very useful.
259_12	0.166	0.834	0.0	-0.3804	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused.
259_13	0.08	0.92	0.0	-0.1027	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player.
259_14	0.0	0.704	0.296	0.2732	well that was not a simple task.
259_15	0.11	0.89	0.0	-0.2732	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3's (actually wma files) and then using the probram to transfer.
259_16	0.149	0.851	0.0	-0.5511	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer, becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate.
259_17	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.296	buy this for the storage and price, avoid it if you know nothing about computers.
260_1	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	buy this instead of an ipod.
260_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod.
260_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper.
260_4	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4404	the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface ".
260_5	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.4927	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer.
260_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also the ipod has games on it.
260_7	0.0	0.862	0.138	0.1531	games are ok for a cell phone, but mp3's are for music.
261_1	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this thing roxxorz.

261_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on.
261_4	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.296	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway.
261_5	0.45	0.55	0.0	-0.5994	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product.
261_6	0.0	0.731	0.269	0.4692	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine.
261_7	0.094	0.906	0.0	-0.2924	the headphones aren't the best, but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity.
261_8	0.17	0.72	0.11	-0.1531	the battery life seems good, takes very lttle time to charge, it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs.
261_9	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.6925	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation, but it's a very user friendly player imo.
261_10	0.0	0.736	0.264	0.6943	i haven't messed with the firmware at all, the player worked perfect for me right out of the box.
261_11	0.0	0.431	0.569	0.765	all-in-all, this is another excellent creative product.
261_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you have the money and need 40 gb, this is the player for you.
261_13	0.0	0.692	0.308	0.5994	it's small, light and nice looking and the display is decent as well.

262_1	0.286	0.714	0.0	-0.3412	it doesn't get any better than this.
262_2	0.078	0.723	0.199	0.7708	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one, and now that i have it i couldn't be happier and i'm convinced it's the best one out there.
262_3	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.3089	many people have written about the software being its one downfall, personally i haven't had a single problem with the software, i'm running windows me.
262_4	0.041	0.849	0.11	0.5173	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy, and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player, so it won't take up space on your pc hard drive.
262_5	0.0	0.751	0.249	0.7165	the software runs smooth, it's nice to look at, it's very organized, easy to follow and makes things very simple.
262_6	0.184	0.816	0.0	-0.3566	the controls on the player are very simple, no need for a manual.
262_7	0.0	0.703	0.297	0.886	the player is fast and sounds great, it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music, or making it sound like you're hearing the music in a huge auditorium.
262_8	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.136	the battery lasts very long when playing music, but writing files to the player drains the battery fast, so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files.
262_9	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.6908	playlists can be made on the fly, without aid of a computer, and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists.
262_10	0.064	0.679	0.257	0.6245	the software couldn't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream, i couldn't give this anything but a 5, i wish there was a 6.

263_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i purchased and returned this product, but not because of any glaring flaws in the design.
263_6	0.143	0.714	0.143	0.0	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device.
263_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3.

263_9	0.0	0.797	0.203	0.4215	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category.
263_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	here's why:  1. i don't need the nomad at the office.
263_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i have my mp3's stored on my workstation.
263_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	2. i don't need the nomad at home for the same reason (although using it to sync between the two pc's might be a reason enough to get it.)
263_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	3. it's a hazard in the car.
263_14	0.106	0.835	0.059	-0.3699	the navigation is nice enough, but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks, hundreds of albums or artists, or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving.

263_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	) 3a.
263_17	0.118	0.637	0.245	0.3806	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 wasn't as easy as i would have liked.
263_18	0.129	0.871	0.0	-0.5106	the bottom line:  if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions, i'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk.
263_19	0.0	0.663	0.337	0.8641	sure it's " old school " to carry a cd wallet around, but it will be easier to manage and i'll save around 250 bucks.
263_20	0.333	0.53	0.136	-0.3818	one major complaint:  my only significant complaint is sound quality.
263_21	0.101	0.899	0.0	-0.2263	the eax sound enhancement feature didn't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq.
263_22	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this did not give me enough control.
263_23	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter.

264_2	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.2732	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players.
264_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so then i came across the ipod (10 gb).
264_4	0.0	0.773	0.227	0.824	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one.
264_5	0.0	0.704	0.296	0.2732	well i decided to get this one.
264_6	0.0	0.852	0.148	0.3912	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket.
264_7	0.0	0.717	0.283	0.7579	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player (at that size and the price).
264_8	0.052	0.839	0.109	0.1987	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it, it will be a breeze.
264_9	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4939	enjoy.
265_1	0.0	0.612	0.388	0.5859	in a word... amazing i got this for christmas.
265_2	0.046	0.819	0.135	0.7783	i was going to get a 10gb ipod, but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com (battery lasts 18 months;  it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99...  what a big improvement... lol) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers, i realized this is a much better buy.
265_3	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.5927	not only is it more affordable, but its a better player for windows, which is what i have.
265_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	anyway, on with the review.
265_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so far i've only had it since christmas, so i cant tell you much about the battery life.
265_6	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.2023	it hasnt gone below the second notch (i charge mine whenever i'm at home and not using it), so the battery life seems fine (so far).
265_7	0.411	0.443	0.146	-0.4939	software: for the people who complain about software, please, stop complaining.
265_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	once you hook the thing up to the computer (via the usb cable), the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it's there &amp; installs the drivers.
265_9	0.0	0.886	0.114	0.4019	from there, you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player (with the help of the media sniffer... read the manual).
265_10	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.296	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags &amp; that takes a while to do if your mp3 files don't have them.
265_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you're copying cds with windows media, its really simple to give your songs id3 tags, so thats what i do.
265_12	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	oh... and file transfers are fast &amp; easy.
265_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the player: it's silver.
265_14	0.148	0.648	0.204	0.1531	a little weighty (9 ounces... no biggie), but otherwise fine.
265_15	0.204	0.796	0.0	-0.5941	people complain about the scroll wheel, but its not a big deal at all (though it is just a little annoying at times).
265_16	0.0	0.256	0.744	0.4404	it's easy.
265_17	0.0	0.608	0.392	0.7003	the buttons are easy to use, and its easy to navigate.
265_18	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.4404	the big backlight makes things easy to see, and the writing is big enough for people to see.
265_19	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.4588	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature.
265_20	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can customize bass, etc.
265_21	0.0	0.926	0.074	0.1901	like usual, but also you can customize the sound of the player (like how it would sound in a concert hall, jazz club, etc).
265_22	0.0	0.435	0.565	0.3804	its really cool.
265_23	0.0	0.441	0.559	0.5859	sound quality is amazing.
265_24	0.091	0.53	0.379	0.819	i was expecting worse, but its really good (especially if your files have good sound quality).
265_25	0.0	0.85	0.15	0.3182	you can also slow a song down &amp; speed it up, which is cool too.
265_26	0.58	0.42	0.0	-0.63	but the earbuds suck!
265_27	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	buy new ones asap.
265_28	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	every time you move your face or something they pop out.
265_29	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	for a 250 dollar player, they could have thrown in nice headphones.
265_30	0.0	0.858	0.142	0.1655	a remote would have been cool too... but lets not push it.
265_31	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh... one more thing.
265_32	0.345	0.655	0.0	-0.2755	i forgot, the case doesn't fit.
265_33	0.319	0.681	0.0	-0.7262	my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty, but the case isnt that great.
265_34	0.06	0.94	0.0	-0.1531	so far the player froze on me once (i started pushing buttons before it loaded) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that.
265_35	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button &amp; you're golden.
265_36	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also, you can store data on it, which is a plus.
265_37	0.0	0.771	0.229	0.6412	for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod, don't bother, this is a much better buy.
265_38	0.0	0.239	0.761	0.4926	hope i helped!
266_1	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	simply doesnt shine.
266_2	0.015	0.815	0.17	0.9712	i'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder...  what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox...  based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible (which by hardware standards... they were)...  but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software, the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo...  now we come to the zen xtra...  first i'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good...  the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad (but still rather larger than i had expected)...  what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software.
266_3	0.138	0.862	0.0	-0.3071	not just the transfer software (which was a hellishly horrible experience) but also the player's software.
266_4	0.067	0.767	0.166	0.9482	first of all, many actions that the player utilizes don't make sense..  bookmarks for example, are an excellent feature... but not on this player...  rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area, the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made..  this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks...  the dynamic playlists (" now playing ", i belive creative calls it) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate...  well, anyway i could go on and on on why this player didn't meet my expectations...  i'll just say this...  for the average music listener not expecting much... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player...  but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback... i can't recommend this product.
267_1	0.26	0.385	0.356	0.25	excellent product with a few minor problems.
267_2	0.113	0.812	0.076	-0.0844	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software, it doesn't care if you load cds onto the hard drive.
267_3	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.4404	over time, i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer, and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive.
267_4	0.0	0.615	0.385	0.6124	many people recommended the ipod, and i borrowed one from a friend.
267_5	0.0	0.738	0.262	0.7778	while the ease of use was very impressive, i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player.
267_6	0.178	0.822	0.0	-0.5994	also, there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die (which they will).
267_7	0.0	0.79	0.21	0.6115	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now, and i am very happy with it.
267_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it's only slightly heavier than the ipod, and has a longer battery life.
267_9	0.064	0.713	0.223	0.719	the storage capacity is great for me --  i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free.
267_10	0.0	0.91	0.09	0.4497	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod, but i have gotten use to them, and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price.
267_11	0.0	0.85	0.15	0.3919	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming, but i think it would have been with the ipod as well.
267_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer, using my work computer instead.
267_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer.
267_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work.
267_15	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4404	if the music had been on my home computer, the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly.
267_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i have an older computer, running windows 98 se, and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker.
267_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software.
267_18	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when you load a disc, you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks.
267_19	0.078	0.922	0.0	-0.3182	while the listing process is accurate for track names (unlike windows ' reliance on the amg, which frequently gets track listings out of order), the results can be odd.
267_20	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.0772	the cd will be classified into a number of genres, and in multidisk sets, you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance.
267_21	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for example, jimi hendrix's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock.
267_22	0.101	0.899	0.0	-0.2263	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock.
267_23	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can change any of these, but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it.
267_24	0.241	0.759	0.0	-0.721	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names.
267_25	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad.
267_26	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	again, you can change this, but it's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you don't have the title of the other disk in front of you.
267_27	0.213	0.787	0.0	-0.4019	other tagging problems result (i think) from the nomad's operating system.
267_28	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk, it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second.
267_29	0.16	0.719	0.122	-0.4709	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music, but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi.
267_30	0.0	0.942	0.058	0.0772	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately.
267_31	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.0772	the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing.
267_32	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.2755	also, i can't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order.
267_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	finally, making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually, and are organized by cd, which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order.
267_34	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in other words, to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist, you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it.
267_35	0.155	0.845	0.0	-0.481	you don't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad, where cds are listed separately.
267_36	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.0772	you need your computer, however, if you want to add tracks to a playlist.
267_37	0.25	0.602	0.148	-0.296	these are minor problems, and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them.
267_38	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds, i would have spotted them sooner.
267_39	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also, if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer, this would not have been an issue.
267_40	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.6115	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product.
267_41	0.093	0.808	0.098	0.0387	apple's ipod is dominant now, but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly.

268_2	0.247	0.753	0.0	-0.3875	simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod.
268_3	0.0	0.608	0.392	0.7964	even better, ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap.

269_7	0.041	0.843	0.116	0.5574	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources, you can't do this on the ipod (except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player).
269_8	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4404	second, the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer.
269_10	0.215	0.62	0.165	-0.2942	if the hard drive on your computer should fail, better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone!

272_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around.
272_3	0.104	0.896	0.0	-0.1027	here's a basic run-down from what i learned:  flash card memory vs. hard drive (i.e.
272_4	0.053	0.947	0.0	-0.1027	why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb (40,000 mb) player only cost  mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them.
272_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact.
272_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that's why you have these things that can be keychain size.
272_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	tiny!
272_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory.
272_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song, to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory.

272_11	0.142	0.858	0.0	-0.5367	cheaper to produce, holds a lot, heavier and has moving parts which means it's a little more prone to damage from being banged around.
272_12	0.0	0.862	0.138	0.4939	that said, they are pretty sturdy machines and i wouldn't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory.
272_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just be aware of it.
272_14	0.108	0.892	0.0	-0.1779	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players.
272_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a 256 mb player (roughly 60 songs for me) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb (30,000 mb) player (roughly 6,650 songs) sells for only slightly more.
272_16	0.085	0.915	0.0	-0.1027	it's because the 256 player uses flash memory (smaller / lighter) and the 30gb uses a hard drive.
272_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that's the first thing to understand.
272_18	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so consider what you're going to use the device for.
272_19	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4215	if you're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm, i'd recommend flash memory.
272_20	0.052	0.899	0.049	-0.0258	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel, i'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books.
272_21	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	review of zen xtra - 40 gb  the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity.
272_22	0.0	0.831	0.169	0.2584	this didn't bother me too much because it's still a decent size.
272_23	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.4404	it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly.
272_24	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.7351	the front cover (which you remove to take out the battery) feels flimsy but when snapped on, the device still feels pretty solid.
272_25	0.073	0.927	0.0	-0.2263	as some other reviewers noted, after it was connected to the computer for a bit, it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it.

272_34	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i thought the software was decent enough - it wasn't complicated to learn at all.
272_35	0.091	0.732	0.176	0.2152	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh, not a big deal.
272_36	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here.
272_37	0.343	0.657	0.0	-0.5719	it is slightly larger than an ipod, no doubt about it.
272_38	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for me, that was the only drawback.
272_39	0.0	0.556	0.444	0.6115	i'm really happy with this purchase.
272_40	0.083	0.823	0.093	0.069	also, when i installed the software, it said that windows xp hadn't approved something with the drivers, etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability.
272_41	0.0	0.606	0.394	0.6369	if you're like me, that will definitely make you pause.
272_42	0.06	0.794	0.146	0.4692	after i reviewed the manual (a pdf file included on the cd), i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it wouldn't cause problems and, in fact, it hasn't.
272_43	0.0	0.605	0.395	0.6742	so if you have xp, be prepared for this and don't be alarmed.
272_44	0.034	0.724	0.242	0.8165	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money, i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it.
272_45	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.4215	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size.

273_5	0.065	0.744	0.191	0.8402	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things: the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect, fast as hell in music transfer, controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button, great sound and ive heard many mp3 players, a ton of different equilizer type deals on here.
273_6	0.125	0.77	0.104	-0.2434	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious: a little larger than other mp3s but still light, the software takes some time to get used to (maybe 10-15 mins), and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall.
273_7	0.086	0.914	0.0	-0.3919	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything.
273_8	0.0	0.629	0.371	0.9042	ive seen em all, the archos, dell, ipods, everything... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion.

274_2	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.25	granted this is cheaper than an ipod.
274_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	cheaper in every way.
274_4	0.043	0.957	0.0	-0.0191	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket.
274_5	0.116	0.768	0.116	0.0018	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it doesn't sinc with contact lists, phone numbers, address books, ect.

274_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it also has unproven battery life.
274_8	0.037	0.935	0.028	-0.1027	everyone who says i can't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time (the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months, conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies.
274_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens, or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it).
274_10	0.053	0.893	0.054	0.0195	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that, an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it.
274_11	0.0	0.728	0.272	0.7269	i'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do.
274_12	0.082	0.848	0.069	0.1531	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels, first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks, flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store, which, if you ever plan to pay for your music, is by far the best.
274_13	0.059	0.754	0.187	0.6808	before anyone says hey you haven't used the product, i have, my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product.

276_4	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.7351	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd, good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me.

276_7	0.097	0.903	0.0	-0.4019	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure, the " duplicate name " problem stems from the actual file name, not from the song's title / artist / album.
276_8	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3182	solution?
276_9	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.2732	simply configure the mediasource software (or windows media player, or your ripper-du-jour) to create file names that include artist and (especially) album names in addition to track names.
276_10	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.5106	using this method, i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected, and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums.
276_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc, you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player.
276_12	0.097	0.903	0.0	-0.4215	my one issue with the mediasource software is that, despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service, the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field.

276_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how does it sound?
276_15	0.0	0.812	0.188	0.7003	to my ears, a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd, and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player.
276_16	0.831	0.169	0.0	-0.5994	no complaints there.
276_17	0.0	0.679	0.321	0.8689	the eax features are pretty cool, as well, as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that, for example, compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train.
276_18	0.0	0.738	0.262	0.7506	navigation could be better, but there isn't really anything the zen xtra can't do once you've gotten comfortable with it.
276_19	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.7351	at the end of the day, what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go, and the zen xtra's combination of price, capacity and features easily meets those criteria.

278_10	0.0	0.791	0.209	0.4404	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players, i'd be covered.
278_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but they offer only a 3-month warranty (on all of their players, including the zen xtra).
278_12	0.635	0.365	0.0	-0.539	so i'm screwed.
278_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but you don't have to be.
278_14	0.0	0.698	0.302	0.6369	if you buy a creative mp3 player, be sure to get the optional extended warranty.
278_15	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4404	or better yet, buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty.
278_16	0.104	0.581	0.315	0.7845	it's really a shame, because otherwise, creative mp3 players are very good, and have the best sound quality of any players on the market.

279_4	0.0	0.918	0.082	0.4005	despite all the hype about ipods, i knew i wanted something different, because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer, and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online.
279_5	0.0	0.72	0.28	0.6656	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative, and i have not been disappointed.

279_7	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.4404	first, the battery is replacable by the user, because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod.
279_8	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	it was easy enough to remove the front plate, and there was only one way the battery could be inserted.
279_9	0.079	0.829	0.092	0.1082	creative also sells batteries via its website, so there's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery.

279_12	0.166	0.747	0.087	-0.2263	you can create playlists, drag &amp; drop songs and playlists to your player, and rip directly from cd to your player.
279_13	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4927	and with usb 2.0, transferring music to your player is incredibly easy.
279_14	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.2732	you can also delete songs from the player itself, and create playlists - on the fly - on your player.
279_15	0.0	0.699	0.301	0.7832	the sound is great, and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise.
279_16	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.4748	i thought i'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it, but the included earbuds work quite well.
279_17	0.374	0.499	0.127	-0.6651	they could be more comfortable, but no complaints in the sound department.
279_18	0.0	0.755	0.245	0.6369	i've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too.

279_25	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.4404	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case, so you could see the display without opening it.
279_26	0.18	0.82	0.0	-0.296	that's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra, though.
280_1	0.0	0.526	0.474	0.2023	important zen information.
280_2	0.071	0.773	0.157	0.4588	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues.
280_3	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.4404	zen good points:  1. i achieved my basic objective; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more.
280_4	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.4019	2. most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next; it's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous.
280_5	0.044	0.898	0.058	0.1779	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i don't even notice the click.
280_6	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.3716	flaws:  1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip, catalog &amp; burn music if you are starting from scratch; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen (278 cds; 3,400 tracks; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps) and guess what?
280_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mediasource did not recognize my tags!
280_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource.
280_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i don't think so.
280_10	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.4404	btw, if you * are * ripping your cds, mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct &amp; uncluttered ] tag information.
280_11	0.113	0.707	0.18	0.323	2. despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality, i experienced a flaw using eax.
280_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player.
280_13	0.241	0.759	0.0	-0.2263	when i turned eax off the static disappeared.
280_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present.
280_15	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	creative are * the * sound people for computers, i can't understand why eax would introduce static.
280_16	0.535	0.465	0.0	-0.3182	is eax faulty?
280_17	0.492	0.508	0.0	-0.4404	is my unit defective?
280_18	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	was i just unlucky at that moment?
280_19	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	was it a full moon that night?
280_20	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i haven't figured it out yet.
280_21	0.126	0.874	0.0	-0.0772	3. mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws.
280_22	0.0	0.788	0.212	0.2235	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision.
280_23	0.32	0.68	0.0	-0.5719	many reviewers refer to it as " clunky " or " difficult " - heed their warnings.
280_24	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.5994	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files;  i didn't use it long enough to know, but clearly you need to use it with caution.
280_25	0.135	0.822	0.042	-0.4306	4.the zen * stores * data files, but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk (they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched).
280_26	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in other words, the zen is not a convenient data storage device; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection (see point 1. for some sizing information).
280_28	0.0	0.763	0.237	0.2914	5. the zen does not have a stop button!
280_29	0.109	0.891	0.0	-0.296	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons, first the pause button, then the " next track " or " previous track " button.
280_30	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.1139	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version.
280_31	0.176	0.758	0.066	-0.5423	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews (with many complaints about the lack of stop button) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out &amp; document it.
280_32	0.0	0.943	0.057	0.1877	6. the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge; it does not charge by usb cable; this is not tragic, but usb recharging would be a convenient (additional) choice.
280_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb; it does not on the zen nx.
280_34	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	7. mediasource did not install on my personal notebook.
280_35	0.185	0.815	0.0	-0.7391	it referred to a " microsoft jet database engine " error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem;  i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error.
280_36	0.274	0.492	0.234	-0.3919	creative provided e-mail support;  i followed their advice but that failed, too.
280_37	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.2023	i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine.
280_38	0.246	0.635	0.119	-0.4939	so it is probably " just bad luck " on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error.
280_39	0.0	0.588	0.412	0.5994	however, it did motivate me to find a work-around solution.
280_40	0.131	0.563	0.306	0.7783	third party software to the rescue  after much frustration (above) i found the notmad explorer; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer &amp; organization problems.
280_41	0.0	0.72	0.28	0.8126	i am not associated with the company, i am not providing a url, but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily.
280_42	0.088	0.883	0.029	-0.4019	this provides drag &amp; drop transfers of music between the computer &amp; zen; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen (.
280_43	0.146	0.762	0.093	-0.5603	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp, but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists); it doesn't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray!
280_44	0.067	0.846	0.087	0.2232	notmad has other features too, but this is not an advertisement so please see the company's web site for more information...  conclusion:  if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod &amp; avoided the zen.
280_45	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.5719	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software.
280_46	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.6908	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip...  to summarize, i am using the creative zen as a mobile device;  i am using musicmatch to rip &amp; catalog (and if i choose, download) music;  i am using notmad explorer to move music &amp; playlists between the zen &amp; my computer.
280_47	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4404	the only creative software i am using is the device driver (s).

281_5	0.0	0.717	0.283	0.8513	the sound quality is fantastic (cd quality) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd's or tapes!

281_9	0.0	0.848	0.152	0.5824	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated.
281_10	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software.
281_11	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.4404	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things.
281_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name (and they are long).
281_13	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.3182	whereas some folks have the " ipod ", i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " (not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx ").

282_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in a quick summation, here is what i found.
282_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	+ the memory (40 gb) is staggering.
282_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it may have taken several years to fill this up.
282_7	0.065	0.718	0.217	0.8422	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit  + screen was good, easy to read  + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great.
282_8	0.143	0.857	0.0	-0.128	- the software that came with it was tough to load.
282_9	0.182	0.727	0.091	-0.3612	i got weird messages about it not being ok'd by microsoft (or something like that), then i thought it failed to load, then it loaded.
282_10	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.2023	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch.
282_11	0.286	0.714	0.0	-0.3412	not good if you're taking this traveling.
282_12	0.335	0.512	0.154	-0.2787	the top did not fit well into the unit.
282_13	0.145	0.8	0.055	-0.448	(felt defective)  - the cover that came with it didn't fit very well  - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation wasn't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage.
282_14	0.164	0.836	0.0	-0.2411	i wasn't sure how long it would take before it would break.

283_4	0.0	0.661	0.339	0.6249	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality.
283_5	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.7003	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer (and vice versa) was easy too.
283_6	0.078	0.587	0.335	0.7992	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it's easy to use and effective.

284_3	0.068	0.932	0.0	-0.296	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly, leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player.
284_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched.
284_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i can't comment on the quality of the audio, because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd.

285_5	0.0	0.752	0.248	0.8053	when i bought it late last year, there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal, but it sounded like a fair tradeoff.

285_7	0.131	0.709	0.159	0.2006	reading the reviews, it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it.
285_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that's been my experience.

285_11	0.0	0.408	0.592	0.4404	now i know better.
285_12	0.141	0.859	0.0	-0.3182	i've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose.
285_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack?
285_14	0.109	0.891	0.0	-0.296	so now i've got to call their customer " service " (of course, no 800 number) to send the thing back.
285_15	0.146	0.732	0.122	-0.128	from the other reviews i've read, it sounds like that won't be the end of my troubles.
285_16	0.101	0.807	0.092	-0.0772	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because, as other reviewers have pointed out, the construction is pretty flimsy.

285_18	0.414	0.36	0.225	-0.4767	like other reviewers, installation was hell.
285_19	0.508	0.492	0.0	-0.4767	subsequent behavior even worse.
285_20	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	about 10% of the time it can't find the device when i attach it to my pc.
285_21	0.07	0.895	0.035	-0.2732	after i had it a couple weeks, it got into a state where it could never find the device, no matter how often i rebooted my pc, reset the device, reloaded drivers, etc, etc.
285_22	0.175	0.397	0.429	0.4939	creative's online support was no help at all.
285_23	0.255	0.745	0.0	-0.6249	in fact, i'd have to rate it among the worst i've ever encountered.
285_24	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	finally, i uninstalled and reinstalled the software, the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing.
285_25	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.5423	to my amazement, even that process was error-prone.
285_26	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i haven't a clue why.
285_27	0.0	0.59	0.41	0.5496	that doesn't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability.
285_28	0.0	0.786	0.214	0.4588	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement.
285_29	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but that's a moot point now.
285_30	0.121	0.81	0.069	-0.2764	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be, at best, a 40gb portable hard drive, albeit one on which i can't create folders, or, at worst, a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again (i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating).
285_31	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my gut tells me i'll also end up buying an ipod.
285_32	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.4939	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars, i'll end up spending more than twice that.
285_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	be forewarned.
285_34	0.144	0.856	0.0	-0.4939	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks, depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software.
285_35	0.117	0.376	0.507	0.8074	now, even 1 star seems like i'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt.
286_1	0.655	0.345	0.0	-0.5849	very bad company.
286_2	0.325	0.675	0.0	-0.3412	i will never buy a creative product again.
286_3	0.085	0.915	0.0	-0.3818	i purchased a jukebox, it got fried while being recharged, they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing.
286_4	0.145	0.592	0.263	0.4201	no way, now i have an ipod and i'm a very happy man.
286_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac.
286_6	0.161	0.593	0.246	0.25	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os.
286_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what kind of a company does that!
287_1	0.0	0.355	0.645	0.8977	great value &amp; great sound; carry your entire collection!
287_2	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.875	pros:  1) great sound (> 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod's " unspecified " ratio) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers.
287_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with my sennheiser 497 headphones, the volume is loud enough at 12 (max is 20).
287_4	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.2732	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers.
287_5	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.4404	2) the player user interface (ui) is intuitive to use, and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection.
287_6	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.5859	3) the nomad explorer (winxp style interface) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player.
287_7	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.6369	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad.
287_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	4) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers (1 song / sec!).
287_9	0.0	0.757	0.243	0.7269	5) the cheap, user-replaceable battery ($ 50 from creative) is a great advantage over the ipod's battery which costs $ 100 to replace.
287_10	0.0	0.654	0.346	0.5719	6) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod's.
287_11	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.6124	7) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate.
287_12	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.6486	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk (by accident) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather (by design) and it has continued to work fine.
287_13	0.0	0.64	0.36	0.8957	8) creative mediasource, although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer, is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service (gracenotes).
287_14	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album, artist, song title, etc.
287_15	0.097	0.697	0.206	0.4653	i don't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags.
287_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc (2.4 ghz with 1gb ram) with 52x drive.
287_17	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.6369	c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer.
287_18	0.0	0.893	0.107	0.34	9) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time.
287_19	0.158	0.658	0.184	0.1027	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning.
287_20	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.5002	10) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album, shuffle, etc., is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter.
287_21	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.4926	11) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player  12) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device (5717 songs, 491 albums and counting)!
287_22	0.048	0.952	0.0	-0.2584	cons:  1) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it.
287_23	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	2) music organization is based on id3 (by genre, artist, album, etc.
287_24	0.259	0.741	0.0	-0.5994	) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information.
287_25	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.3089	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music.
287_26	0.179	0.821	0.0	-0.1877	3) folders cannot be created for the audio files.
287_27	0.051	0.785	0.165	-0.1063	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags.
287_28	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files (through mediasource) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files.
287_29	0.147	0.667	0.187	0.1531	4) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras.
287_30	0.134	0.698	0.169	0.1531	5) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative's marketing.
287_31	0.0	0.611	0.389	0.7906	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great, as do third-party wireless transmitters.
287_32	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary.
287_33	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	6) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed.
287_34	0.0	0.765	0.235	0.5574	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case.
287_35	0.068	0.932	0.0	-0.4019	7) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch.
287_36	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.4404	experience:  once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player.
287_37	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it (which i could do with my flash player).
287_38	0.0	0.944	0.056	0.2382	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen.
287_39	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also, i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates.
287_40	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	recommendations:  1) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive.
287_41	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4404	2) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one.
287_42	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.3089	3) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year.
287_43	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.5106	4) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player's usability (the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio, home receiver, etc.)
287_44	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.4939	5) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped.
287_45	0.039	0.646	0.314	0.936	resources: http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net  pros summary:  great sound; good interface; replaceable, powerful battery; good software; wake-up, sleep timers; multiple play modes  cons summary:  not plug &amp; play; relies on id3; no fm or recording  bottom-line:  can't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go.
287_46	0.0	0.613	0.387	0.69	my favorite is to play " any track " - am rediscovering my music!

289_7	0.209	0.791	0.0	-0.6136	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod's $ 150.  cons:  the only thing i don't like about this is the cover does suck.
289_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i dropped it from the couch, landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out.
289_9	0.0	0.755	0.245	0.2366	it's kinda heavy, kinda like having a walkman.

289_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes.

292_2	0.0	0.898	0.102	0.6369	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99.  the combination of the price, storage size, and player features makes this player the best on the market.
292_10	0.154	0.846	0.0	-0.4588	the battery stays charged for a long time, and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter.
292_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	connect the player to your computer (via usb), open up mediasource, and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra!

292_15	0.097	0.903	0.0	-0.4019	minor complaints: 1) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player, the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable.
292_16	0.0	0.943	0.057	0.34	that is, if a folder on your computer called " mp3 " has slayer (thrash metal), stravinsky (classical), and ice cube (rap) in it, you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually.
292_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player, but not the folder name.

296_2	0.057	0.862	0.08	0.0521	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod, creative zen, rio karma and iriver ihp - you'll notice that each has their pros and cons; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later.
296_3	0.078	0.645	0.277	0.8885	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed, fault proof, good product support, easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and don't buy yet.
296_4	0.107	0.782	0.11	0.0176	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while.

296_9	0.273	0.663	0.064	-0.7845	it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents; however, enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can't be used.
296_10	0.371	0.629	0.0	-0.8687	some of the more geeky (non-apple type) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface.

296_12	0.0	0.852	0.148	0.3089	ipod can be used as an external disk, and apparently stores files without problem.
296_13	0.077	0.862	0.062	-0.128	however, the music and data are apparently not separated; ipod reviewers complain about " white noise " in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization.
296_14	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.0772	synchronizing music among computers, if you have more than one, seems to be an issue; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized.

296_16	0.116	0.784	0.101	-0.1027	reviews of apple's support are generally poor; they seem to address issues in warranty, which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item.

296_18	0.196	0.804	0.0	-0.5267	ipod has no stop button; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century ".
296_19	0.306	0.542	0.152	-0.6908	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality, poor product support, difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack.

297_2	0.522	0.478	0.0	-0.6652	but with a low price, comes lower quality.
297_3	0.0	0.489	0.511	0.9403	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price.
297_4	0.215	0.579	0.207	-0.0258	the catch is it's built like a piece of crap.

297_6	0.0	0.801	0.199	0.357	i didn't abuse it, i charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out.

297_8	0.251	0.679	0.07	-0.7259	so i contacted customer service at creative, but they said, " if the product seems broken, we cannot help, " or something to that effect.

298_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	pro: 1.  removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years.
298_6	0.168	0.678	0.155	-0.0681	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up.

298_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the size is small (just a little bit bigger than an i-pod.)
298_11	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	4.  easy to use: a lot of reviews has mentioned about this  con:  the software, mediasource, cannot work on my pc.
298_12	0.0	0.606	0.394	0.3818	(laptop, intel p4-2.0, xp os).
298_13	0.238	0.762	0.0	-0.481	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here.
298_14	0.145	0.699	0.156	0.0516	in fact, each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place.
298_15	0.153	0.682	0.165	0.0516	however, the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems.
298_16	0.188	0.625	0.188	0.0	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem.
298_17	0.0	0.945	0.055	0.3612	ps: (mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping, tagging, music database managing, music file transfering, and more)  now i use ms mediaplayer, musicmatch (free downladed), and " explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player " to replace the mediasource.
298_18	0.227	0.613	0.16	-0.5483	in short, this player is good at size, value, hardware design but really bad at its software
299_1	0.0	0.435	0.565	0.8316	a great player, excellent sound quality, hovewer, has flaws.
299_2	0.143	0.571	0.286	0.3612	alright, well i read alot of these reviews, and i read alot of bad and good things about this player.
299_3	0.294	0.543	0.163	-0.4005	well to say, i had a very bad history with players.
299_4	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.7424	one broke, one got stolen, and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350.  if you are planning to buy that player, do not!
299_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
299_6	0.206	0.794	0.0	-0.3818	i returned it once, then i sent it back, and it is crap.
299_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	now getting back to this.
299_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i ordered this player for christmas, and so far i have it for only 2 weeks.
299_9	0.0	0.773	0.227	0.6249	now as others said, so far this player is an awesome player, there are flaws.
299_10	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.8555	cons:  1.  the display is awesome, you can see everything you want and read it clearly  2.  huge storage space, i loaded my entire collection of music, which isnt that much, 400 songs, and still have 26 gb, out of the 28 provided to you.
299_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	(28 not 30 because software itself takes space).
299_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
299_13	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.3716	3.  the sound is awesome, but if u put it too loud, depends on yoursound quality, the sound might crack.
299_14	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.7269	4.  with eax on, you can modify your sound, with 4 different presets, which is pretty good, you can get different variations with it.
299_15	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.7579	5.  if you use software correctly, put in all the id3 tags, you will get an awesome database collection, from which you can easily access your songs.
299_16	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	you can also search for your song, which is good.
299_17	0.0	0.68	0.32	0.7684	6.  i dont know what other people are saying, but the software is awesome.
299_18	0.0	0.764	0.236	0.7877	you can easily access ur files, and easily fill in the id3 tags, which can take a while with a big collection of music, but if your not lazy, you will do it without a problem.
299_19	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.3657	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3, so its not a problem.
299_20	0.0	0.663	0.337	0.765	7.  battery recharge, is an awesome thing, because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours.
299_21	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.34	8.  when you turn on your player, the player turns on really fast, and the music continues to play, as you left it when you were turning it off.
299_22	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	9.  you can manage your profile, change the contrast of backlight, make different type of display, either list or tabbed.
299_23	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.2023	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface, you can see the interface as modern or classical.
299_24	0.097	0.684	0.219	0.4854	there is an alarm, i still havent used it yet, but it should be good.
299_25	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.4215	there is a clock, and date, which can get helpful.
299_26	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	10.  the player has firmware, which will remove the glitches, if there are any.
299_27	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.8025	11.  the music plays awesome, never skips, even if u run for a bit, so you can listen to music without interruption.
299_28	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	cons:  1.  the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with, in this player, is the battery life.
299_29	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours, and what i recieved was 6-8.
299_30	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	5 hours max.
299_31	0.0	0.757	0.243	0.7713	i did it like this  eax on: 6 hours eax off: 8.5 hours  2.  the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said.
299_32	0.0	0.95	0.05	0.3612	3.  you need the software to actually transfer files  4.  the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on, 60 percent of the time, it sais, shutting down, which means i have to turn off, and turn it on again, which is not to my likings.
299_33	0.265	0.635	0.1	-0.4344	also, the player sometimes freezes, not a very big problem, but can also be annoying.
299_34	0.084	0.732	0.184	0.5423	(but as any hard drive, all of them freeze at certain points)  well thats about it, and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up, stil havent happened to me, and i hope it doesnt.
300_1	0.0	0.462	0.538	0.7906	easy to use, massive storage space, sounds great.
300_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and also, it's priced very affordably.
300_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player (everything music file i have is on there) with room for about 2,500 more.
300_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a similarily priced 15gb ipod wouldn't have been nearly enough room.
300_5	0.0	0.883	0.117	0.6249	having my entire music collection is great when travelling (both on plane and car trips) and i don't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it's all there.
300_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage.
300_7	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.5569	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted.
300_8	0.155	0.729	0.116	-0.2144	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones.
300_9	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good.
300_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference.
300_11	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4404	accessing files by artist and album (i mostly look things up by artist) is easy and intuitive.
300_12	0.0	0.941	0.059	0.25	possibly the biggest advantage this player has (if price wasn't enough) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery.
300_13	0.055	0.945	0.0	-0.2732	since batteries do run out on everything, this will also be a big money-saver since ipods, irivers, rca, dell, all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician (apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement).
300_14	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.802	try before you buy if at all possible: although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod, the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface.
300_15	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.2584	i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad.
300_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the ipod's white plastic look / surface doesn't suit me.
300_17	0.0	0.48	0.52	0.764	i like the nomad's color better, but it's not terribly flashy.
300_18	0.092	0.822	0.086	-0.0516	the mini ipod's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage.
300_19	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my advice to mp3 buyers: consider how much storage space you will need, then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them.
301_1	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	good for the price.
301_2	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.5106	i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it.
301_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the pros:  price!
301_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	almost half what an ipod would cost you!
301_5	0.232	0.768	0.0	-0.4973	i don't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me.
301_6	0.0	0.458	0.542	0.8576	sound quality is wonderful, i really like the smart volume sound normalization.
301_7	0.165	0.678	0.157	-0.0258	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway.
301_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough.
301_9	0.0	0.73	0.27	0.7424	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!
301_10	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	cons.
301_11	0.339	0.169	0.492	0.2263	creative software stinks.
301_12	0.778	0.222	0.0	-0.5423	it's horrible.
301_13	0.0	0.774	0.226	0.5255	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more!
301_14	0.0	0.918	0.082	0.1779	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i didn't notice after first day.
302_1	0.0	0.196	0.804	0.6249	great player.
302_2	0.0	0.64	0.36	0.6696	have had the player since xmass and love it!
302_3	0.0	0.651	0.349	0.9246	pros:  great sound, very long battery life (i routinely play it for 12 + hours), very fast recharges rate, removable battery, storage size, nice screen, firmware updates, and great price.
302_4	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.6597	cons:  short warranty (3 months, so i got the extended warranty at best buy), occasional freeze up (easily fixed by popping out battery), somewhat flimsy navigation wheel.
302_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	neutral:  i didn't even try the included software.
302_6	0.144	0.789	0.067	-0.3182	i just bought notmad manager ($ 25) and file transfers are easy drag and drop, songs stored by id3 tags not by folders, needs to have software on computer to transfer files, no window on case (nice case otherwise.
303_1	0.194	0.504	0.302	0.3612	i don't see what everyone's problem is - i love this player.
303_2	0.0	0.729	0.271	0.7717	this is an excellent player, especially for the price, with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod.
303_3	0.061	0.746	0.193	0.7717	for a price that's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster, and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some.
303_4	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.7184	here are the pros and cons (few there are) in detail:  look / design:  the system is terrific in size and design, imo looking better than the ipods.
303_5	0.147	0.853	0.0	-0.4497	it's bigger, but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods.
303_6	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	it's very solidly built, and has a nice dense feel to it.
303_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least.
303_8	0.097	0.731	0.172	0.4548	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod's as well, in that you don't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you're there.
303_9	0.0	0.676	0.324	0.34	the screen's large and easily read.
303_10	0.0	0.757	0.243	0.775	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face, that sometimes comes off a bit easily, but besides that it's perfect.
303_11	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	sound: exceptional, though i can't really compare it to the ipod.
303_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	from what i've heard it's at least equal.
303_13	0.097	0.793	0.11	0.0772	like others have mentioned, you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they're on lower bit levels.
303_14	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.296	there's no so-called background hiss that i've noticed, at least so far.
303_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	interface - practically seamless.
303_16	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags, which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver.
303_17	0.0	0.862	0.138	0.6059	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order (with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out) it actually turns out to be really handy.
303_18	0.0	0.51	0.49	0.7717	it's a dedicated music playing device, anyway, so this serves it better.
303_19	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can find any song quicky by an artist, album, or genre search.
303_20	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.6297	playlists can be generated on the fly (which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus) or by using the software, and there are a bevy of eq options.
303_21	0.18	0.82	0.0	-0.296	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance.
303_22	0.0	0.702	0.298	0.8173	software:  as i mentioned before, the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said, though notmad may still work better.
303_23	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	it's easy to transfer, preview, and organize files.
303_24	0.0	0.597	0.403	0.6597	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point, as well.
303_25	0.38	0.62	0.0	-0.5994	it was no problem for me to use their software.
303_26	0.171	0.829	0.0	-0.4497	some may complain that there's no drag-and-drop capability, but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player, not a computer accessory or hard drive.
303_27	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience.
303_28	0.166	0.717	0.117	-0.841	overall, i'm giving this 5 stars as i've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over, but as i've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack, hissing, or scroll wheel problems show up with me too.
303_29	0.0	0.6	0.4	0.6115	so far, however, i'm a very happy customer.
303_30	0.0	0.596	0.404	0.8316	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod.
304_1	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does not function correctly, unhelpful customer service.
304_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	don't buy this player.
304_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed (don't get me started on that piece of junk!)
304_4	0.0	0.602	0.398	0.5106	and expected it to be flawless.
304_5	0.146	0.854	0.0	-0.34	unfortunately, after loading 280 + songs, all i get now is " player either not connected or busy."
304_6	0.121	0.879	0.0	-0.296	it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do.
304_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	don't buy this player.
305_1	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why can't it be rated zero stars?
305_2	0.197	0.611	0.192	-0.0516	do not buy this product --  i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended.
305_3	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke.
305_4	0.326	0.674	0.0	-0.8271	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products, which is very dumb.
306_1	0.495	0.505	0.0	-0.2411	o man, not cool.
306_2	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.296	ok, im writing yet another review, about a week from my previous one.
306_3	0.0	0.217	0.783	0.802	honestly, i love this player.
306_4	0.333	0.667	0.0	-0.5423	one horrible flaw, or mayybe more than one.
306_5	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.6249	once again, the sound is awesome, the batterly life is only 6-8 hours, and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life.
306_6	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.296	ok so i donno about what other people said, how the player breaks and stuff, and the headfone jack, fortunately that did not happen to me.
306_7	0.329	0.671	0.0	-0.5994	however, my hard drive did fail, and i have not dropped it once.
306_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	therefore im saying im returning it right now, and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra (same replacement).
306_9	0.101	0.794	0.105	0.0258	if that one fails too, and i hope if it does, let it happen in the first 90 days, not later, cuz thats the warranty.
306_10	0.359	0.641	0.0	-0.4215	if it does, ill give up.
306_11	0.402	0.598	0.0	-0.5719	basically wat happened, is that the hard drive failed.
306_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	thats it.
306_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i cant do anything about it, and i have to send back.
306_14	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.6597	the only good thing about this whole process, is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back, because of the price difference between when i bought it, and now.
306_15	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars, instead of 1.  you know why?
306_16	0.206	0.653	0.141	-0.2263	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull, this player is awesome, it just breaks fast, which is horrible.
306_17	0.155	0.665	0.18	0.1618	now honestly, i love this player, but with all seriousness, i would not recommend it to other people, because of the breakdown flaw.
306_18	0.231	0.633	0.136	-0.2732	and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod, that crap sucks big donkey..... never mind.
306_19	0.221	0.517	0.262	0.2778	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown..  honestly, the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players.
306_20	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this is all i have to say.
307_1	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what a junk.
307_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what a junk.
307_3	0.099	0.901	0.0	-0.0258	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes.
307_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode.
307_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can't use nomad until you get home.
307_6	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox.
308_1	0.326	0.674	0.0	-0.5256	you will be very disappointed with this product.
308_2	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups: (1) those who have had the product for a few weeks and (2) those have had the product for a few months.
308_3	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it.
308_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the price is way below an ipod of the same size.
308_5	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod.
308_6	0.0	0.61	0.39	0.4927	the sound quality is very good.
308_7	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the controls are somewhat harder to use, and there are some oddities about the software tagging system, but most people can live with this.
308_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	because of the large capacity of the nomad, owners can load hundreds of cds on to it.
308_9	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for most people, they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection.
308_10	0.0	0.78	0.22	0.4767	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific.
308_11	0.0	0.588	0.412	0.6369	they fall in love with the product.
308_12	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and then it breaks.
308_13	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires.
308_14	0.162	0.838	0.0	-0.4019	typically, the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others.
308_15	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	the nomad is sent back to creative labs.
308_16	0.096	0.749	0.156	0.25	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period, creative will charge you to fix it.
308_17	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in my case, the bill was $ 81, about a third of what i paid for it.
308_18	0.0	0.607	0.393	0.8127	like many others, i had not abused the product, and had tried to take care of it.
308_19	0.079	0.817	0.105	0.2008	if my level of care wasn't good enough, i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two.
308_20	0.078	0.854	0.068	-0.1027	i'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed, and will not hold up to normal use.
308_21	0.278	0.722	0.0	-0.4019	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem.
308_22	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.4005	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover, which is taken off to have access to the battery, seemed to come undone very easily.
308_23	0.18	0.82	0.0	-0.5106	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire.
308_24	0.219	0.781	0.0	-0.6814	even if it hasn't expired, creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty.
308_25	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase.
308_26	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it, and get used to having it.
308_27	0.34	0.66	0.0	-0.8503	so when it breaks, as it will, you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad.
308_28	0.124	0.876	0.0	-0.1761	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back.
308_29	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you will have a very expensive paperweight.
308_30	0.231	0.769	0.0	-0.3412	there are not a lot of good options out there.
308_31	0.0	0.863	0.137	0.6486	most people say buy an ipod, but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery.
308_32	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops.
308_33	0.047	0.644	0.308	0.8271	maybe creative will come out with a better design, although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again.
308_34	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products.
308_35	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod.
308_36	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	whatever you do, don't buy this product.
308_37	0.178	0.822	0.0	-0.0772	you will be sorry if you do.

309_4	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the other day when i was listening to a song, it locked up and will not do anything now.
309_5	0.403	0.597	0.0	-0.4019	it says i have a harddisk problem.
309_6	0.068	0.932	0.0	-0.3089	and since i'm out here i can't mail it back under my 90 days and they won't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty.
309_7	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.4404	it worked good for a while.
309_8	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it did lock up on me a couple of times, and then it just froze and now i'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk.
